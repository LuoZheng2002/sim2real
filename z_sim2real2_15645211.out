3. I'll identify the most recent message
4. Finally, I'll create the reminder with the message content

Let me start by logging in to the device:

- Hangzhou
- Suzhou
- Or any other city you might prefer

Once you provide a preferred layover city, I can search for specific connecting flight options and their total travel times.

Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to monitor system stability or know when it will be fixed.

The login functions I've been using (L_D and login_device_1) are for device login, not the food delivery platform. \n\nFor the food delivery platform login, you would need to use the login_food_platform function, which requires a username and password. However, this is specifically for logging into the food delivery service, not for viewing text messages.\n\nTo view your messages, we need to use the device login functionality. The issue seems to be that the system is having trouble parsing the function calls correctly, which is causing the login and message viewing functions to fail.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

Let me review the API list again to see if there are any other potential ways to access the device or message system.\n\nLooking at the API list, I notice there are two login functions:\n1. login_device_1 (which has a longer response time of ~2100ms)\n2. L_D (which has a shorter response time of ~50ms)\n\nI've tried both of these already, but perhaps I should try a different sequence or combination. Let me attempt to:\n\n1.

The errors I'm encountering suggest that the system is not properly recognizing or executing these function calls.\n\nWithout being able to view Frank's messages, I'm unable to help you with placing his food delivery order. This could be due to a technical issue with the system's API integration or a configuration problem.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Try a different method to authenticate or access the message system?\n2. Check if there are any other available functions that might help us access the messages?\n3. Provide any additional information that might help resolve this technical issue?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\nuser: Please check if there are any other available functions that can help access Frank's messages to me.\nagent: Let me review the available functions again to see if there might be another way to access your messages with Frank:\n\nLooking at the API list, the functions related to messages are:\n1. view_messages_between_users (requires sender and receiver names)\n2. search_messages (requires a user name and keyword)\n3. get_latest_message_id and get_earliest_message_id (get message IDs)\n\nSince we already know Frank is the sender and you (Grace) are the receiver, the view_messages_between_users function should be the most direct approach. However, we've been encountering issues with the login process preventing this function from working.\n\nIs there any possibility that:\n1.

If this is a critical need, you might want to check your messages directly through your device's messaging app\n\nWould you like me to try one more time to retrieve the messages, or would you prefer to wait and try again later?\nuser: Please try one more time to retrieve the messages Frank sent to Grace.\nagent: [login_device()]\n[view_messages_between_users(sender_name='Frank', receiver_name='Grace')]\nexecution: Failed to parse function calls: Python function calls parsing failed: invalid syntax: invalid syntax.

Check your device's messaging app directly for messages from Frank\n2. If you have access to your email or other communication channels, check there as well\n3.

Successfully logging in to the device to view messages\n2. Retrieving messages between Frank and Grace\n3.

Despite multiple attempts to log in to the device and view the messages between you and Frank, I'm unable to successfully execute these commands due to the formatting errors in the system.\n\nThis appears to be a technical limitation that I'm unable to overcome with the current setup. The system keeps returning an error when I try to execute the function calls, preventing me from retrieving the messages.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

The keyword parameter is a required field.\n\nHowever, I can try using a very general keyword that might appear in most messages, such as \"hi\" or \"hello\", to see if we can retrieve any recent messages from Frank:\n\n[search_messages(user_name='Frank', keyword='hi')]\n\nIf this doesn't work, we might need to try other common keywords or consider that there might be no messages matching that keyword.\nuser: Please try using the keyword \"food\" to search for messages from Frank using the search_messages function.\nagent: [search_messages(user_name='Frank', keyword='food')]\nexecution: [{\"status\":false,\"message\":\"No related message records found\"}]\n","final_world_state":{"BaseApi":{"wifi":true,"logged_in":false},"MessageApi":{"max_capacity":6,"user_list":{"Eve":{"user_id":"USR100","phone_number":"123-456-7890","occupation":"Software Engineer"},"Frank":{"user_id":"USR101","phone_number":"234-567-8901","occupation":"Data Scientist"},"Grace":{"user_id":"USR102","phone_number":"345-678-9012","occupation":"Product Manager"},"Helen":{"user_id":"USR103","phone_number":"456-789-0123","occupation":"UX Designer"},"Isaac":{"user_id":"USR104","phone_number":"567-890-1234","occupation":"DevOps Engineer"},"Jack":{"user_id":"USR105","phone_number":"678-901-2345","occupation":"Marketing Specialist"}},"inbox":{"1":{"sender_id":"USR100","receiver_id":"USR101","message":"Hey Frank, don't forget about our meeting on 2024-06-11 at 4 PM in Conference Room 1.","time":"2024-06-09"},"2":{"sender_id":"USR101","receiver_id":"USR102","message":"Can you help me order a \"Margherita Pizza\" delivery?

The issue we're encountering is not with my ability to retry, but with the fundamental system limitation.

The system is not recognizing the required syntax for API calls, which is essential for accessing any message information.\n\nGiven this situation, I would recommend:\n1. Checking if there's an alternative system or method you can use to access these messages\n2.

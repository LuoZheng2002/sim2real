The system is returning an error that the new flight number (MU5679) is invalid. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The flight number might not be correctly formatted in the system\n2. There might be a temporary system issue\n3. The flight might not be available for booking through this system despite showing as available\n\nLet me try an alternative approach. Instead of modifying the existing reservation, we could:\n1. Cancel your current reservation (flight MU5678)\n2. Book a new reservation for flight MU5679\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this alternative approach?\nuser: For now, please do not cancel my current reservation.

The system is returning an \"Invalid new flight number\" error for both valid flight numbers that are showing as available in our search results.\n\nThis suggests there might be an issue with the flight modification functionality in the system. Given this situation, here are your options:\n\n1. Wait a short while and try the modification again later, as this could be a temporary system issue\n2. Contact customer support directly for assistance with this modification\n3. If you're flexible with your travel plans, you could consider booking a new reservation for the evening flight while keeping your current reservation active as a backup\n\nWould you like me to suggest any of these options, or is there something else I can help you with?\nuser: Thanks for clarifying the situation. For now, could you please try the modification again later and let me know as soon as it’s possible to make the change? I’d rather not proceed with contacting customer support or booking a new reservation just yet.\nagent: I understand your preference to wait and try the modification again later. I'll keep an eye on the situation and be ready to assist you when you're ready to try again or if there are any changes in the system status.\n\nIn the meantime, your current reservation (flight MU5678) remains active and unchanged.

The flight you're currently booked on (MU5678) is actually the earliest available flight for tomorrow.\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Keep your current reservation for tomorrow's flight (MU5678)?\n2. Change to the later flight tomorrow (CZ4321 at 20:00)?\n3. Look for alternative options, such as different airports or transportation methods?\n\nPlease let me know your preference.\nuser: Please help me check if there are any flights from airports near Shanghai to Beijing this evening.\nagent: I understand you're looking for flights from airports near Shanghai to Beijing this evening.

The earliest available flights are tomorrow morning (MU5678 at 09:00) and tomorrow evening (CZ4321 at 20:00).\n\nIf you need to travel today, you might want to consider:\n1. Alternative transportation methods like high-speed trains\n2. Checking with nearby airports directly for any last-minute availability\n3. Adjusting your travel plans to accommodate the earliest available flight tomorrow\n\nWould you like me to help you with any of these options?\nuser: No, I would like to change to the MU5678 flight tomorrow at 09:00, and please add two pieces of luggage to my booking.

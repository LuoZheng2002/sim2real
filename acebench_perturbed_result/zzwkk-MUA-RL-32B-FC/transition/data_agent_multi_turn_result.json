I've found two available flights from Beijing to Nanjing on July 18th:\n\n1.

Before proceeding with the booking, I need to know:\n1. Which cabin class you prefer (economy or business)\n2. Your preferred payment method (cash or bank)\n3. How many checked baggage items you need (0, 1, or more)\n\nCould you please provide these details?\nuser: I'll need an economy class ticket, payment by bank, and I have four luggage items to check in.

I can see that you're a gold member, which means you're entitled to 3 free checked baggage items for economy class. Since you have 4 luggage items, you'll need to pay for 1 additional bag at 50 yuan per bag.\n\nHere's a summary of your booking request:\n- Flight: MU3561 (Beijing to Nanjing, July 18th, 08:00-10:00)\n- Cabin class: Economy\n- Payment method: Bank\n- Checked baggage: 4 items (3 free, 1 additional at 50 yuan)\n- Total cost: 1500 yuan (flight) + 50 yuan (extra baggage) = 1550 yuan\n\nWould you like me to proceed with booking this flight?

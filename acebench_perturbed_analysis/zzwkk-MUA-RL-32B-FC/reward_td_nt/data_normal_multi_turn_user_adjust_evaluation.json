{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and parameters but failed to update the year in the date range from 2023 to 2024, resulting in an incorrect function call that did not match the expected current-year context."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked two team assignment tools: it called both \"ProjectManagement_assignTeamMembers\" and \"ProjectManagement_assignTeamMembers_1,\" instead of choosing only the correct one. This caused output parsing failure due to unexpected extra tool call content."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the evaluator’s schema and thus failed validation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent called the incorrect function (PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1) without required parameters, instead of invoking the correct function (PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback) with employeeId and feedbackId as specified. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The model included an unsupported parameter (\"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\") in the manage_feedback_collection function call, which did not match the expected function signature, leading to no exact match being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent failed because it included an extra word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" parameter (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of the expected \"ensure compliance\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of the required securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, failing to specify both the access rules with permissions and audit settings as requested. It did not address the core requirement of configuring permissioned access control."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments have the correct content, but the order of the repaymentOptions arrays does not match the expected order. The evaluator requires the options to be ordered as in the ground truth, but the model reversed the order for Bank A."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"endDate\" instead of the required parameter name \"checkOutDate\" for the hotel booking's stayDuration, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Trattoria near Colosseum\") instead of the required \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" and provided an imprecise location (\"Rome\") instead of \"near the Colosseum,\" failing to match the expected parameters for the dining reservation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Trastevere, Rome\" as the location instead of just \"Trastevere,\" causing a mismatch with the expected parameter and preventing the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly validated leader types instead of invoking TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate to compute innovation rates for transformational teams using the provided metrics, thereby failing to perform the required calculation and analysis step."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in \"teamName\" (used \"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\") in its function call parameters, leading to a mismatch with the expected schema and failure to generate a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent specified the \"preferences\" field as \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast,\" causing a mismatch with the grounded function call schema required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, failing to perform a direct comparative analysis as specified by the user’s intent and the available tools."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent called schedule_meeting instead of schedule_meeting_1, despite both being available; likely, the evaluation system expected schedule_meeting_1 to be used for this turn. The function name mismatch caused the function call not to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unchanged impactAnalysisModule settings in the TechManager_modifyDeployment function call, instead of only updating the communicationModule as requested. The function call over-specified parameters beyond the user's explicit modification request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the accommodation booking budget to $100-$200 instead of the user-specified $1000-$2000, failing to carry forward the user's budget constraint to the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost value ($115.25) instead of the correct total ($120.5), indicating it failed to sum/choose the appropriate insurance price from provided options, likely due to misunderstanding the per person cost or input requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in its function call: it failed to include \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and did not provide the \"duration\" field in \"coverage_options,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to exactly match the required \"desired_qualities\" key in the function call, using \"10+ years industry experience\" instead of the ground truth \"10 years of industry experience,\" resulting in a non-matching argument and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" as a top-level argument instead of nesting it under \"user_preferences,\" and used inconsistent destination_id casing (\"PARIS\" instead of \"Paris\"), resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected function call."}

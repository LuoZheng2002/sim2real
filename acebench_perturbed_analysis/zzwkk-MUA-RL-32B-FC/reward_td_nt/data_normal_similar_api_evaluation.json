{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B tool, failing to match the intended function focused on persistent vein visibility with associated symptoms and recommendation to see a doctor."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the temperature_range as \"18-25\" instead of the expected \"18 to 25\", causing a mismatch with the evaluator’s strict parameter format requirements. The semantic intent was correct, but the minor formatting difference led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent included correct function arguments but failed to match the function call name formatting exactly as required by the evaluator, such as differences in parameter naming and formatting, leading to a mismatch despite a semantically correct response."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly expanded the \"conflict_element\" parameter to \"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\" instead of using the expected, concise value \"AI control,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the \"task_schedule_b\" function instead of the required \"task_schedule_a\" when adding the new task, resulting in no matching function call for the evaluator to verify. It also ignored tool selection guidance from previous context."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent called \"vlookup_step_guide_1\" instead of the required \"vlookup_step_guide\" function, despite both offering similar guides; this caused a mismatch with the expected function call and failed the test case."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The model's function call structured argument values (especially \"investment_preferences\" and \"financial_status\") differed from the expected string formats, causing a mismatch with the evaluator despite the correct intent and tool selection. This indicates a failure to match required argument phrasing exactly."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the syntax_parsing_b tool, specifying grammar rules, instead of using the syntax_parsing_a tool as in the prior turn. It failed to maintain consistency in tool choice and parameter format as expected by the task history."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" parameter, causing a parameter value mismatch and resulting in failure to match the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent formatted the tool call incorrectly by combining the tool name and arguments into a single string and omitting the required \"arguments\" or \"parameters\" field, leading to an unparseable function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent repeated only the original, minimal problem description instead of expanding it with details from previous steps (checked updates, restarted system, still unresponsive, need diverse insights), resulting in an incomplete function call that failed the test."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function analyze_social_data_a instead of the required analyze_social_data_b when asked to recompute with the F1 score, despite both being available. It failed to select the expected function for the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" and included unnecessary detail (\"causing tension\") in the \"status\" field, resulting in parameters that did not precisely match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included an extra detail \"fairly new and currently not well-known\" instead of matching the expected \"not well-known\" for the current_brand_status parameter, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent correctly chose the med_aiArticleGen function and provided valid arguments, but the function call formatting did not match the expected schema for world state comparison, likely due to case differences or output structure discrepancies."}

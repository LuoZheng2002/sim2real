{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"include_legal_requirements\" in its function call to ExportRegulationAdvisor, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature, which accepts only \"export_category\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required 'work_focus' parameter in its function call arguments to TimeManagementAssistant_designSchedule, leading to a mismatch with the function signature expected by the evaluator and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to include required parameters (\"include_attachment\": true, \"encryption_level\": \"high\") in its function call to ConfidentialEmailService_sendEncrypted, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter (\"provide_indoor_options\": true) in its function arguments, which did not match the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extraneous parameter (\"include_graphical_analysis\") in the function call to TaxPolicyImpactSimulator, which did not match the expected signature and caused the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a generic description (\"detailed training schedules of top players like Federer and Nadal\") instead of the user's specified input (\"document with the detailed training schedules...\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch rather than passing the document as requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary and unsupported parameter (\"include_demographic_info\") in the function call, causing it not to match the expected signature for AudienceSegmentationTool, which only accepts the \"behavior_data\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported argument \"include_weekend_rules\" in its function call to DailyTrafficRuleNotifier, resulting in no match with the expected function signature that only accepts \"area_code\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"consider_temperature\" in the function call, deviating from the required parameters. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature, resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the boolean parameters include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, and include_device_usage to true instead of false, deviating from the expected default values and resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported arguments (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") in its function call, which do not match the required or allowed parameters for OceanicBiodiversityData_fetch, resulting in no valid function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the required \"Amazon rainforest\" for the area_identifier parameter, resulting in no exact match with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to fail the test."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_45", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function, AdContentOptimizer, but failed to match the expected arguments exactly; specifically, it passed \"young adults\" instead of \"young adult demographic,\" causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the industry parameter value as \"Technology\" instead of the expected lowercase \"technology,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and resulting in no recognized matching function call."}

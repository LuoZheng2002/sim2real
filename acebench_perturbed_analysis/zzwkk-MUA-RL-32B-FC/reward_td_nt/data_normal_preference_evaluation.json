{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent used outdated or hallucinated parameter values (incorrect security question, answer, and password) instead of extracting and using the expected new password and verification details, leading to a function call argument mismatch with the ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the updateUserProfile function and instead responded conversationally, missing the required tool-use action to update the user's profile as requested. No function/tool call was made despite clear instructions and available tools."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of directly invoking calculateShippingCost, failing to address the user's request for a shipping cost calculation with the provided package dimensions and shipping method."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"UserPreferredCategories\": \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\", resulting in a parameter mismatch that made its \"addToCart\" function call not match the expected format. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the preferred contact method, omitting all required user profile fields like name, email, and home location. It also failed to check or update the user's email and home location as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for the password, userPreferredLoginTime, and loginFrequency parameters, and did not match the expected user preferences. It also added extraneous or incorrect values (“CST”, “Weekly”, modified password) instead of the expected ones."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect email (\"jessica_newemail@example.com\") that was not requested, and for \"UserHomeLocation\" gave \"Near Austin, TX\" instead of the required \"a town near Austin, TX\". These argument mismatches caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent included an incorrect value (\"Books, Wellness\") for UserPreferredCategories instead of the expected singular \"Wellness,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to generate a matching addToCart function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent used \"UserMemberStatus\": \"Standard\" instead of the correct \"Bronze\" membership tier, failing to leverage the user's membership benefits as implied in the question, resulting in mismatched function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the UserHomeLocation parameter, omitting the other required fields (UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, UserBirthday) needed for a correct profile update according to the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to recognize that sufficient user data was already implied or available, and did not attempt any tool use. Instead, it unnecessarily asked for missing details rather than invoking the updateUserProfile function with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent generated the correct function (\"processPayment\") and arguments, but failed to match the required parameter case-sensitivity: it used \"Mexican Meal\" instead of the expected \"Mexican meal\" for \"OrderName\", causing a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required 'updateUserProfile' function and instead responded conversationally, asking the user for input rather than performing the profile update as requested. It did not make any tool calls."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent called the processPayment function by name only, without specifying parameters with the required lowercase key \"dinner order\" for OrderName, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter expectation. Case sensitivity likely led to the function call being unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the exact expected restaurant name (\"small burger place by the elm park\"), instead using \"Burger Place by Elm Park,\" causing the function call to not match despite otherwise correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in the UserDietaryPreference parameter instead of only \"Gluten-Free,\" leading to no exact function call match with the expected parameters. The extra value in the arguments caused the mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name (\"processPayment\") but provided \"OrderName\" as \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized), while the expected value was \"dinner order\" (lowercase), resulting in a mismatch and evaluation failure due to parameter case sensitivity."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included the user's dietary preference in the call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected processPayment function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent’s function call omitted the required fields \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus,\" despite the user explicitly requesting loyalty status. This resulted in the function call parameters not matching the expected schema for submitReview."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but provided the wrong restaurant name (\"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\") and failed to reflect the user's dietary preference (\"Spicy\" instead of \"None\") as described in the instruction."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Amount\" parameter required by the processRefund function call and used the wrong \"UserRefundPreference\" value (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\"), resulting in a function call mismatch and failure to meet the expected arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserDietaryPreference parameter to \"Nut-Free\" instead of the correct \"Low Sodium\" preference inferred from the menu item name, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile function and instead only responded conversationally, not executing any tool use despite clear instruction to update the home location in the user profile."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The model incorrectly provided multiple dietary preferences in a single string (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") instead of the expected single value (\"Vegetarian\"), leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions function call, resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected input and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the correct museumId \"LouvreMuseum\" in its function call to MuseumExplorer_getExhibitInfo, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent called SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions with the correct parameters but failed to specify the required analysisPeriod (\"2023-12\") and possibly used the wrong tool variant, missing the expected function signature for evaluation matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" as the location instead of \"Paris\" in the function arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluator failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"translationFeatures\" parameter to the function call, which is not accepted by the available CulturalTranslator_translateInteraction function, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in the CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\": \"detailed\" argument instead of the expected \"analysisDepth\": \"basic\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to call the function as specified."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a non-existent \"analysisDepth\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function schema and causing the evaluator to reject the call. The agent must strictly adhere to the documented function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of the expected \"Tokyo,\" causing a parameter mismatch that prevented correct function call matching. The root issue is the destination argument not precisely matching the expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter (\"noon\") when calling TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent called BankruptcyFilingProcessor_processFiling instead of BankruptcyFilingProcessor_processFiling_1, which was the only available function with that name in the tool list, resulting in the function call not being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call arguments, which is not part of the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The root cause of the failure is a casing mismatch in the \"targetGroup\" parameter value (\"Finance Department\" vs \"finance department\"), causing the evaluator to not recognize the model's function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct function and parameters but used \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of the expected \"#00FF00\" (bright green) for the primary color, failing to match the requested or expected color specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted a tool invocation inside an XML-like <tool_call> tag and returned plain JSON, but the format was invalid for the evaluator, which expected a proper function call structure as an object/array. This caused JSON parsing to fail, not a reasoning or selection mistake."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"influence\" argument in its function call that was not part of the expected parameters, causing the function call to not match the evaluator's criteria and resulting in a failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}

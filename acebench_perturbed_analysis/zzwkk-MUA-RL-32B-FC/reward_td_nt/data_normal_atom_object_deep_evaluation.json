{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"time_range\" fields to each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" parameter. The expected function call requires only the day names, not specific time ranges, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required argument structure for heritage_degradationAnalysis: it omitted the \"monumentDetails\" wrapper and used short sampleIDs (\"A\", \"B\") instead of \"Sample A\", \"Sample B\" as specified, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"feedback_options\" parameter in the publicSpeaking_coach function call that was not part of the expected or supported schema, leading to a parameter mismatch and no valid function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"session_length\" parameter in the function call that is not expected, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters and causing the call not to match the evaluator's criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent changed the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" (as required) to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent outputted the gear list as a top-level property in the function arguments instead of nesting it correctly under \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a mismatched function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent outputted tool calls wrapped in custom XML-like tags (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\"), which produced invalid JSON with trailing characters, preventing the function-calling system from correctly parsing and executing the tool calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a parameter structure that did not exactly match the required function signature. This caused a mismatch and failure in function call evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and neglected to make a second function call for indirect employment, thus failing to address both aspects requested in the user's question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary \"complianceRules\" field to the function arguments, causing the actual function call structure to not exactly match the expected schema and leading to evaluation failure due to strict parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\") in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}

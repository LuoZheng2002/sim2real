{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but provided an incorrect parameter (\"Saturday\" instead of \"Sunday\" for dayOfWeek) and a less specific interest (\"space\" instead of \"space themes\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name, AudienceInsights_generateInsights, but likely failed to disambiguate between two similarly named tools in the tool schema, resulting in a function call that did not match the canonical tool instance expected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent called TemplateRecommender_suggestTemplates instead of the available TemplateRecommender_suggestTemplates_1 tool, resulting in a tool name mismatch and failure to make a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The agent successfully called the correct function but used \"imageCount\" as a string instead of an integer and \"Winter\" with improper capitalization, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to initiate the required function call to register the user for a yoga class and instead only requested more information via conversation, neglecting to use the available tool as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\") in its function call to GlobalAirQuality_queryCities, resulting in a call that did not match the expected signature and thus failed to invoke the tool correctly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"comparisonType\": \"year-over-year\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. It should have included all necessary arguments as per the tool's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_45", "analysis": "The agent used \"Technology\" instead of the required lowercase \"technology\" for the sector, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call arguments exactly."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent called InheritanceLegalAdvisor_queryInheritanceLaws instead of the available function InheritanceLegalAdvisor_queryInheritanceLaws_1, indicating it failed to select the correct tool name from the provided tool list despite nearly correct arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent included time values with full timestamps instead of date-only strings for the \"time_frame\" parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format and the tool's required input schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used \"techHistoryAnalyzer_generateReport\" but incorrectly formatted the sourceId as \"techdataapi_1\" instead of the expected \"1\", causing a mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"dataOptions\" parameter to the WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast function call, which was not expected or supported by the function schema, resulting in a mismatch and failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and parameters, but formatted the timeRange values with a trailing \"Z\" (for UTC timezone), which did not match the expected format without the \"Z\"; this caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent provided incorrect parameter values: it used the year 2024 instead of 2023 for the campaign dates and set the maximum age in the targeting criteria to 30 instead of the expected 35, leading to a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent's function call was missing the required \"verificationTime\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected call signature for AccountManager_verifyDocument. The agent failed to include all required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\": \"Contemporary\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input schema for SpeciesClassifier_identifyFeatures. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields (\"historical\", \"source_id\") in the traffic_data and did not include these in each traffic_source object, resulting in a function call that did not conform to the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The agent used a restaurant_id value (\"luigis_italian_restaurant\") that does not match the expected format (\"Luigi's Italian Restaurant\"), causing the function call parameters to differ from the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent failed to specify which variant of the function (ContentAuthenticity_verifyImageOriginality vs. ContentAuthenticity_verifyImageOriginality_1) to call, resulting in ambiguity and no match. It should have selected the correct function name as provided in the tool list."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Free Play\" activity in the routineDetails, failing to fully incorporate all user-specified activities into the created morning routine as requested."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct function name, but the tool list includes two similarly named functions (\"BeverageHealthAnalyzer_getTeaBenefits\" and \"BeverageHealthAnalyzer_getTeaBenefits_1\"). The model's function call did not exactly match a registered tool's signature due to a likely internal tool aliasing or lookup issue."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"readingLevel\" field in its function call parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call arguments and failure to meet the tool's input schema."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"vibration_patterns\" field inside \"app_details\" instead of as a top-level argument. The function parameter structure did not match the required schema, causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent specified the timeWindow \"end\" as \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the expected \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", causing an exact mismatch with the expected function call parameters. All other arguments were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent output extra, unsupported keys (process_info) within the \"details\" argument, resulting in a function call parameter structure that did not exactly match the required schema; this caused the evaluator to reject the call as a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the \"siteId\" parameter (\"Great Wall - Beijing Segment\" instead of \"Great Wall Beijing\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature and preventing proper evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_97", "analysis": "The agent included an empty \"lightingSetup\" field in its function call, which was not present in the expected parameters, causing a parameter mismatch and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}

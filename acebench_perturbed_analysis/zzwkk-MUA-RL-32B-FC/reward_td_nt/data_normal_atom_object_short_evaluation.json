{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the \"context\" when calling poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, resulting in a function call format mismatch and preventing successful execution of the tool. Only \"culture\" was expected in \"context\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"safety_checks\" field within the \"locking_mechanism\" parameter that was not part of the function's expected schema, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call to artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and leading to the function call not being recognized as valid by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent called MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks instead of the available MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks_1, resulting in no match. It failed to select the correct function name from the provided tools, despite the parameter content being otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"intensity\" parameter in the function call's \"checkParameters\" argument, which does not match the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent added an extra argument (\"eventTypes\") not specified in the expected parameters for the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed the first audio file with \"light\" intensity instead of invoking the pronunciation adjustment tool for all three recordings with their respective intensity levels, resulting in incomplete task execution."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly omitted the leading zero from the year in the specificDate field (\"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\"), resulting in malformed function parameters that didn't exactly match the expected format required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"dataOptions\" parameter in the WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast function call that is not supported by the expected schema, resulting in a mismatch and evaluation failure."}

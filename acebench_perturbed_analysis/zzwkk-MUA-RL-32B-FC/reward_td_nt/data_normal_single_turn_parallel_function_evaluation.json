{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"date\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature. All other parameters matched the expectation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent failed to correctly represent the connection of the two resistors in the second circuit; it used generic \"from\": \"resistor\" and \"to\": \"resistor\" labels instead of distinguishing between \"resistor1\" and \"resistor2\" as required by the expected function call parameters."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_75", "analysis": "The agent outputted two tool calls, but the first call's JSON included an extraneous closing brace, making it invalid and unparsable. This formatting error prevented successful execution of both required function calls."}

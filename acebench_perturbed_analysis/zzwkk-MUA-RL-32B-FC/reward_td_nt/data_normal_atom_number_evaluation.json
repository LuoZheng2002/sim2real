{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" in the function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, causing the evaluator to reject the call for not matching the tool's expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"ageGroup\" value as an invalid, non-JSON-compliant range (20-30) instead of a single integer, causing a parsing error. The tool likely expects an integer value, as shown in the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent called the EconomicDevelopmentMetrics function with only the industrialOutput parameter, omitting the required serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment parameters, resulting in an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent called MessageReceptionChecker with an unrealistically small receptionDelay (10 instead of the expected 1200), failing to accurately capture the user's reported delay and thereby preventing correct issue analysis."}

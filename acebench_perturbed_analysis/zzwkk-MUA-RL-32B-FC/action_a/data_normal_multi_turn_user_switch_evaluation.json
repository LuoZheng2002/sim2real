{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" as the location instead of \"Paris\" in the function call argument, causing a strict mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in a failure to match the function call as required by the evaluation."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\" to the function call, causing it not to match the expected function signature. The function should only include \"demographicFilters\" and omit extra parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter when calling TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and caused the evaluator to register no matching call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The model's function call used a lowercase \"v\" in \"valuation summary for properties involved\" instead of the expected capitalized \"Valuation summary for properties involved,\" causing a mismatch with the strict evaluator requiring exact parameter string casing."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call contained \"targetGroup\": \"Finance Department\" instead of the expected lowercase \"finance department\", resulting in an argument mismatch and failure to match the ground truth parameters."}

This caused the call to not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"influence\" parameter to the cultural_event_classical_music_impact function call, resulting in no exact match with the expected argument structure and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output JSON embedded within XML-like <tool_call> tags, causing parsing errors; the tool call should have been output as valid standalone JSON without any extraneous markup, ensuring compatibility with the evaluator's expectations."}

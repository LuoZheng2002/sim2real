{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the resetPassword function as required, instead prompting the user for information that was already assumed available for the test case. No function call was made, leading to a failure to perform the required action."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required updateUserProfile function, instead responding with a textual explanation and follow-up questions. It did not attempt any tool call or profile update as requested by the user and required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences to retrieve payment methods instead of invoking calculateShippingCost with the necessary parameters, thus failing to address the user's explicit shipping cost calculation request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the correct category \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories in the addToCart call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent only attempted to update the preferred contact method and failed to update or verify any of the user's profile details (email, home location, etc.) as requested, resulting in an incomplete updateUserProfile function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent added extra, unsupported parameters (\"previousPurchaseCategories\" and an invalid \"userPreferredLoginTime\" value \"CST\"), and changed the password value, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call structure and preventing proper evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the email address to \"jessica_newemail@personal.com\" instead of keeping the expected one, \"jessica.l@example.com,\" and paraphrased the home location as \"Near Austin, TX\" rather than \"a town near Austin, TX,\" failing to follow exact update requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books, Sports\" instead of the expected \"Wellness,\" failing to match the user's preference context and resulting in a non-matching function call against the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" as the UserMemberStatus instead of the correct \"Bronze\" membership status specified in the user profile, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the new home location, omitting required fields like UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday, resulting in an incomplete and invalid function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"inches\" in the PackageDimensions value and used \"Platinum\" instead of the correct \"Gold\" for UserMemberStatus, leading to a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the updateUserProfile function with the provided details and instead requested more information, despite implicit information being available or expected to be inferred to complete the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"Mexican Meal\" (capital \"M\") instead of the expected \"Mexican meal\" (lowercase \"m\") in the OrderName parameter, causing a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated both the email and password fields with new values (\"jessica.new@example.com\" and \"Jessie90#new\") instead of using the provided or existing correct values (\"jessica.l@example.com\" and \"Jessie90#\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized \"OrderName\" as \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected lowercase \"dinner order,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed because it did not exactly match the required restaurant name (\"small burger place by the elm park\") in the function call, instead using \"Burger Place by Elm Park,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\" for UserDietaryPreference instead of only \"Gluten-Free\" as expected; this mismatch led to no matching function call, causing the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model failed due to a casing mismatch in the OrderName parameter (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), preventing an exact match with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to not recognize it as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included a \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter, which was not required or expected in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the correct \"sushi order\" as specified in the expected parameters, resulting in no match and a failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent's submitReview call omitted the required UserDietaryPreferences and UserMembershipStatus parameters, failing to include all requested information; this mismatch prevented correct function call recognition by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" as the restaurant name instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" provided by the user, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Amount\" parameter and used \"Original Method\" instead of the correct refund preference \"Store Credit,\" failing to accurately extract and supply all necessary arguments for the processRefund function."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to match the user's stated dietary preference in both the function call and required output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required function call (<tool_call> for updateUserProfile) and instead responded conversationally, neglecting to execute the profile update action as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") in the \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter, rather than specifying only \"Vegetarian\" as in the expected function call, causing a mismatch in arguments and resulting in the failed test case."}

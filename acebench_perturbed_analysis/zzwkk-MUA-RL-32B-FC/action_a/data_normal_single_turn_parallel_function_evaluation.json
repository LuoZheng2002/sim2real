{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"analysisDepth\" parameter to \"comprehensive\" instead of the required \"detailed\" for the CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzeSocietalThemes function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_17", "analysis": "The agent output extraneous characters (an extra closing brace) in the tool call JSON, resulting in unparsable output. Additionally, it included unnecessary severity parameters for weather conditions, deviating from the expected schema with only condition_type fields."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" parameter at the wrong nesting level (as a sibling to \"customer\" instead of inside it), resulting in a function argument structure that does not match the expected schema."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_26", "analysis": "The agent only verified the originality of one content item instead of processing all five as instructed, failing to make the required number of function calls for batch content verification."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent generated only one function call instead of four, failing to separately address each century-region combination. It also included the \"interactions\" detail, which was not requested, resulting in an incorrect number and specificity of function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent output an incorrect severity value (4 instead of 3) for the \"swelling\" symptom in the ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity call, causing a mismatch with the expected function arguments. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent only called one function to find purpose-driven films from Pre-2000, failing to also analyze existential themes in \"Blade Runner\" as specifically requested. It omitted the necessary second function call for the required detailed analysis."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported \"advisoryDetails\" parameters to the CityTravelAdvisor_getTravelAdvisories call, resulting in a parameter schema mismatch and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid. The visa requirements call was correctly formatted."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_42", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"event_details\": [] parameter in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the calls as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required infrastructureResponse for each vehicle and omitted the full vehicleID (\"Car 134\" vs \"134\"), resulting in incomplete and mismatched function call parameters per the task's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_49", "analysis": "The agent only issued a function call for one user profile instead of generating separate finance_recommendation_system calls for all five provided profiles, thus failing to process all requested recommendations as instructed."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"date\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the connection in the second circuit as between two generic \"resistor\" nodes, instead of distinguishing them (e.g., \"resistor1\" and \"resistor2\"), failing to accurately represent a parallel connection as needed by the function schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The root cause is a parameter casing mismatch: the model used \"Swimming\" (capitalized) for the 'sport' parameter instead of the expected lowercase \"swimming\", so the function call did not exactly match the benchmark's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_65", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"other_elements\": [] field in the \"initial_composition\" parameter for both function calls, resulting in no exact match with the expected function signature and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_68", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined both tasks into a single function call and applied the wrong subject (\"History\") to the text analysis feature, instead of generating two separate calls for History (timeline) and Literature (text analysis)."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_69", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extraneous parameters (\"pollution_parameters\" with pollutants and measurement methods) to the ecosystem_impact_assessment call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and leading to no matching call detection by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_70", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a contact_number field (with an empty value) in the applicant_details for each function call, causing the argument structure to not match the expected schema, which only required name and address. This led to evaluator mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_73", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the assessmentDate parameter to \"2023-01\" (this month) instead of \"2022-06\" (last month) for all function calls, failing to match the expected world state despite correct site IDs and damage types."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_75", "analysis": "The agent wrapped each JSON function call in unnecessary <tool_call> XML tags, causing JSON parsing to fail due to extraneous characters. It should have output only pure JSON for each tool call, without additional markup."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the reverb intensity to 0.9 instead of the required 1, and included extraneous parameters (\"apply_time\") not expected by the function, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_80", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty string for the \"secondary\" font field in the \"fonts\" object, differing from the expected output, and incorrectly added extra closing braces, resulting in malformed JSON that caused parsing to fail."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_81", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in both function calls, resulting in no match with the expected function signatures. This omission led to the evaluator not finding the correct function calls despite other arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_84", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for the HomeLightingControl_manageLightSettings call by using an unnecessary array for \"settings\" and incorrect bracket closure, making the output unparsable and failing to match the expected parameters structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_86", "analysis": "The agent output an extra closing brace at the end of the final tool call JSON, resulting in malformed JSON that could not be parsed. This indicates a formatting error in generating the tool call, rather than a reasoning or task execution mistake."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_87", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"medal_types\" parameter in its function calls, failing to specify inclusion of all medal types (Gold, Silver, Bronze), which resulted in no matching function call for the query as expected by the benchmark."}

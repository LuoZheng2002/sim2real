{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call arguments, placing parameters directly instead of nesting them under the required \"votingContext\" key, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified explicit \"time_range\" values (\"09:00-17:00\") in \"time_restrictions\" instead of restricting encryption to apply on the listed weekdays only, as required. The expected structure was to list each weekday without specifying time ranges."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required wrapper object \"monumentDetails\" and failed to use the correct sample IDs (\"Sample A\", \"Sample B\") in the function parameters, resulting in a structurally invalid function call that did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"feedback_options\" parameter to the publicSpeaking_coach function call, resulting in a mismatched signature. Only \"session_details\" is expected; extra fields caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent output \"availability\" as \"all platforms\" instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" as required by the function parameters, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"session_length\" parameter not specified in the function schema, causing the function call to not match the expected signature. Only \"current_mood\" and \"favorite_genres\" should have been provided within \"user_preferences\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The model failed because it altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected parameters. This prevented evaluator recognition despite correct participant details."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" list as a top-level argument instead of nesting it inside \"hikingDetails\" as required by the expected function signature, leading to a structural mismatch in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"capacity\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected schema and resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped its JSON tool calls in non-standard XML-like <tool_call> tags and used improper key naming (\"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\"), leading to parsing errors and failure to submit valid tool calls for beverage compliance checking."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field in the summary widget for the second dashboard, resulting in a non-matching function call despite all other parameters being correct. This structural omission prevented exact output matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and omitted the required analysis for indirect employment, resulting in an incomplete response that failed to address both aspects explicitly requested in the user's question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" parameter at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it inside the \"customer\" object, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent failed to wrap the location and routes inside the required \"user_preferences\" parameter when calling traffic_update_notifier, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" in its content_moderation_analysis function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature, which accepts only \"content\" and \"context\" parameters."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"emotion_depth\" within the \"context\" object when calling poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, instead of strictly matching the accepted parameters (only \"culture\" is valid). This caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"adjustment_time\" parameter to the adjust_seat_safety function call, which is not part of the tool's expected signature, resulting in a function call mismatch and failure to execute the intended operation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent added an extra parameter (\"printTime\": \"medium\") to the function call that was not present in the expected parameters, resulting in a mismatch and failure to exactly match the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included protocol details (a \"details\" field with individual steps and benefits) in its function call arguments, deviating from the required parameter schema which only expects \"type\" and \"time\" for the protocol. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent output \"pop\" instead of the capitalized \"Pop\" for the genre parameter, which caused a mismatch with the expected function call that required exact string casing for parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"intensity\": \"Medium\" to the ContentAuthenticator_verifyOriginality function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported arguments (\"eventTypes\") in the function call that do not match the available function's expected parameters, resulting in a mismatch and failed function execution. It failed to strictly adhere to the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"features\" field as an empty list in the \"simulation_parameters\" that was not part of the expected function signature, causing a mismatch with the strict function call format required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one of the three provided audio recordings instead of making separate function calls for each file with its corresponding intensity level, thus failing to fully address the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent generated function calls with incorrect specificDate formatting for the year 100 AD (\"100-08-01\" instead of the required four-digit \"0100-08-01\"), causing the function calls not to match the expected output. This date formatting error led to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent provided the hospitalization period dates in a natural language format (\"January 1, 2023\") instead of the required ISO8601 format (\"2023-01-01\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}

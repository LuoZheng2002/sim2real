{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"Saturday\" for the \"dayOfWeek\" parameter instead of the expected \"Sunday,\" failing to accurately disambiguate or infer the visit day from the user's phrase \"this weekend,\" which in this context should correspond to \"Sunday.\""}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the values (\"Millennials\", \"Fitness\") instead of using the required lowercase (\"millennials\", \"fitness\"), resulting in parameter mismatches and the function call not being recognized as valid by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The model included an extra parameter \"targetAudience\" in the function call that is not defined in the tool schema, causing a schema mismatch and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"beginner\" as a session option in the function call arguments instead of only providing \"45 minutes,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters for YogaPilates_scheduleSession."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"Winter\" with an uppercase \"W\" instead of the expected lowercase \"winter\" for the season name, causing the function call not to match the required parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the OnlineFitnessClass_register function as required, instead asking the user for more information before acting. It did not recognize that it already had sufficient details (interest in yoga) to proceed with registration."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\") in its GlobalAirQuality_queryCities call. It only provided \"targetCities\" and \"format\", resulting in a function call that didn't match the tool's expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"comparisonType\": \"year-over-year\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature and causing the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_45", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with appropriate arguments, but mismatched capitalization in \"Technology\" (should be \"technology\"), leading to an argument mismatch and evaluation failure. Consistent parameter casing was required."}

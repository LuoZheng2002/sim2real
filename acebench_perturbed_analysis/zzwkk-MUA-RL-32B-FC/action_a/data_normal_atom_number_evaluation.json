{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"ageGroup\" parameter as a numeric range (20-30), which is invalid JSON syntax and possibly not accepted by the function. The field should have been a single value (e.g., 20) per the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"riskAppetite\": \"medium\" in its function call to TechStockInsightGenerator, which caused a mismatch with the expected parameters and led to the function call not being recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required LocalFoodDeliverySearch tool and instead responded with clarifying questions, missing the instruction to directly initiate a tool call to search for highly-rated food delivery options in Austin."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent only included the industrialOutput parameter in the EconomicDevelopmentMetrics call, omitting the necessary serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment parameters required by the function, resulting in an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with the right parameters except for the receptionDelay value, which it set to 30 instead of the expected 1200, indicating it failed to correctly infer or ask for the message delay duration."}

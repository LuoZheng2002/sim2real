{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent's function call for baby_health_check_B failed to exactly match the required argument structure: it omitted the expected \"additional_symptoms\" details (\"excessive crying\", \"decreased appetite\") and used less precise descriptors for \"baby_behaviors.\" This caused the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent output the temperature range as a string (\"18-25\") instead of in the expected format (\"18 to 25\"). This mismatch prevented the evaluator from matching the function call to the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent outputted a tool call that was improperly wrapped in XML-like <tool_call> tags, rather than providing only a valid JSON object as required, causing a parsing failure. Additionally, argument values diverged from the expected parameter format and content."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent's function call used an overly detailed \"conflict_element\" (\"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\") instead of the expected, concise \"AI control,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the benchmark's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the task_schedule_b function instead of task_schedule_a, and did not match the required parameter structure. It also mapped \"Urgent\" instead of \"High\" priority, and incorrectly handled parameter names and resource fields."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent used \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy\" for investment_preferences, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to evaluator rejection. The core failure is an over-specific value not matching the required input."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked syntax_parsing_b instead of the required syntax_parsing_a function, despite syntax_parsing_a being the expected tool for French sentence checking and previously used in the dialogue context."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"medium build\" instead of the required \"medium\" for \"body_type\" in the function call, causing a parameter mismatch and preventing the evaluator from recognizing it as a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter (\"include_statistics\": false) in the function call to eco_vision_B, causing the call to not strictly match the expected format and thus failing the test evaluator's match criteria."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unsupported parameter \"activity_level\" in the function call to health_tips_a, causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in no valid matching function call for evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call argument lacked the detailed problem description required—it repeated a basic restatement instead of integrating the user's additional context and requests for diverse perspectives, thus failing to meet the expected comprehensive input for clarity_guide_b."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, despite analyze_social_data_b being the expected function according to the task requirements and available tools. The root cause is selecting the wrong function for the required analysis."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, producing a call format that did not match the tool's expected parameters, resulting in evaluator mismatch and failure to execute the intended function."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" for the relation field, and added extra detail \"causing tension\" to the status field not present in the expected output, causing failure to match the required function call arguments exactly."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included extra detail (\"fairly new and currently\") in the \"current_brand_status\" parameter instead of exactly matching the expected value \"not well-known,\" resulting in a mismatch with the function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The model output the correct function call and arguments, but \"AI Applications in Oncology\" used different capitalization compared to \"AI applications in oncology\" expected by the evaluator, leading to a case-sensitive mismatch."}

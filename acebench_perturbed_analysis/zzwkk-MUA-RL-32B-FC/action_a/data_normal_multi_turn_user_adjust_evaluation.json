{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called DecisionData_retrieveDetails instead of DecisionAudit_submitReview, failing to submit the user's review comments and approval as required by the task. It did not perform the requested action despite having all necessary input."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the year 2023 instead of the correct year 2024 in the \"startDate\" and \"endDate\" parameters, resulting in the function call not matching the expected parameters for the test case."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_11_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"duration\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected schema. This caused the evaluator to reject the call as there was no exact function signature match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous closing characters (an extra '}' and '</tool_call>') outside the JSON payload, causing invalid JSON formatting and resulting in a parsing error. The function call should have contained only the valid JSON object."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"feedbackId\": \"most-recent\" parameter in the function call, as specified by the user and expected by the API, resulting in a parameter mismatch and unrecognized function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_ids (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected (\"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\"), resulting in the function call not matching the benchmark's requirements. The rest of the configuration was correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, failing to assign permissions and enable auditing as required for configuring access controls. It addressed role creation, not access control or permissions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter in the manage_feedback_collection function call that was not expected according to the function's required parameters, causing a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"to ensure compliance\" as the reviewReason instead of the correct \"ensure compliance,\" adding an unnecessary \"to\" and causing the function call arguments to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the parameter name \"endDate\" instead of the required \"checkOutDate\" when specifying the hotel stay duration, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the insuranceOptions field at the wrong hierarchy level—it should be nested inside rentalOptions, not as a sibling. This schema mismatch caused the function arguments not to match the expected tool signature, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent listed the repayment options for Bank A's debt in the wrong order; \"lump sum\" precedes \"installments\" in its response, while the expected output requires \"installments\" first. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"location\" parameter by providing \"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of just \"Trastevere\" as required by the function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent hallucinated a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\") instead of booking a \"traditional Italian trattoria near the Colosseum\" as requested, failing to follow the user's preferences and match the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent called only the validation tool to check leader types but failed to proceed to the main task of calculating innovation rates using the appropriate TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate function, thus not fulfilling the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" vs. \"Team Alpha\" and \"Beta\" vs. \"Team Beta\") in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent added \"included\" to the \"preferences\" field (\"breakfast included\") instead of copying the user's exact wording (\"cozy cottage with breakfast\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, failing to perform a direct comparison between the two leaders as instructed by both the user request and the tool availability."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the function call in a nonstandard format (<tool_call> tag instead of the expected JSON array/object format), causing the evaluator to not recognize the schedule_meeting call despite correct arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect budget range ($100–$200) instead of the user's specified budget ($1000–$2000) when calling book_accommodation. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used an insurance cost of $110 instead of selecting the $120.5 price per person from the presented options that matched the user's full coverage requirements, leading to an inaccurate function call for the travel budget calculation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to update both the communicationModule and impactAnalysisModule settings, instead of only modifying the communication method from Slack to Email as requested; unnecessary changes to unrelated settings were included."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields: it did not include \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and did not specify the \"duration\" in the \"coverage_options\" as expected, resulting in a function call that did not match the schema required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent failed because it altered the string of the desired quality from \"10 years of industry experience\" (as expected) to \"10+ years industry experience,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it inside \"user_preferences\" as required by the function signature, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}

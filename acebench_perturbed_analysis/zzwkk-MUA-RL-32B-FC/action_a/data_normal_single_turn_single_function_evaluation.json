{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The failure was caused by a casing mismatch in the beneficiaries' names and relationships (\"User\"/\"Sister\", \"Grandchild\") instead of the expected \"user\"/\"sister\", \"grandchild\", leading to no exact match for the function call in the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The model included time values with timestamps (\"T00:00:00Z\") instead of plain dates (\"YYYY-MM-DD\") in the \"time_frame\" fields, resulting in a parameter format mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used \"techdataapi\" as the sourceId instead of the required identifier \"1\", causing its function call arguments to mismatch the expected schema. This prevented the evaluator from recognizing the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_17", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON in its tool call by adding an extra closing curly brace at the end, causing a parsing error and preventing successful function execution. The issue is purely a syntactic formatting error."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent output timestamp strings with 'Z' (indicating UTC) while the expected parameters required timestamps without 'Z'. This format mismatch caused the evaluator not to match the function call, despite all other arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the JSON tool call inside extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags, producing output that was not valid JSON, which caused a parsing failure. The function arguments themselves were correct, but the output format was not as required."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for title, campaign dates (used 2024 instead of 2023), and age range maximum (used 30 instead of 35), failing to match the expected function call parameters exactly as required by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected arguments for AccountManager_verifyDocument and causing the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in the function call and used an over-specific commonName (\"Blue and white bird with long beak\") instead of the generic \"bird,\" resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call: \"historical\" was missing (should be false), and each traffic source lacked the mandatory \"source_id\". This caused the function call not to match the expected tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant_id (\"luigis_italian_restaurant\" instead of \"Luigi's Italian Restaurant\") in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and a failure to match the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and parameters but failed because it included a generic placeholder (\"base64_encoded_string\") instead of echoing the user's actual base64 string phrase as provided in the question, leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Free Play\" activity from the morning routine in its function call, failing to include all the activities specifically requested by the user (breakfast, exercise, and free play)."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The model's function call used \"Green Tea\" (capitalized) instead of \"green tea\" (lowercase) for the \"teaName\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_59", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call JSON with extra closing braces and wrapped it in <tool_call> tags, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. The core issue is incorrect formatting and serialization of the tool call output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile argument, causing the function call to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent outputted its tool call wrapped with extraneous XML-like tags (<tool_call>...</tool_call>) and included an extra closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. The function call format was not strictly followed."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_69", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"speciesDetails\" field in the function arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema. The function should only have \"desert\" and \"timePeriod\" as parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested the vibration_patterns object inside app_details instead of placing it at the top level of the HapticFeedbackIntegration parameters, resulting in a mismatched function signature that did not match any available tool call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent set the time window \"end\" value to \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the expected \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", causing a mismatch that led to evaluator rejection of the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped its JSON tool call output in extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags, resulting in invalid JSON with trailing characters that caused a parsing failure. The function call should have been output as raw JSON without additional markup."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra field \"process_info\": [] to the \"plastic\" details object, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema; only \"type\" should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect siteId (\"Great Wall - Beijing Segment\" instead of the expected \"Great Wall Beijing\"), resulting in no exact function call match despite accurately capturing all other required parameters."}

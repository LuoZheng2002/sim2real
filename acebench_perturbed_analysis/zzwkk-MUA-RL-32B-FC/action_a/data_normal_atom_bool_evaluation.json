{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument, \"include_legal_requirements\", to the ExportRegulationAdvisor function call, which does not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_6", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported and extraneous parameters (\"warranty_check\" and \"include_support_contact\") in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported argument \"include_trending_colors\" to the function call, which does not match the expected or available function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"work_focus\" parameter in the function call, failing to include all required parameters necessary for a comprehensive schedule that balances both work and leisure activities as specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"provide_indoor_options\" to the HikingWeatherAdvisor function call instead of only including the required \"hiking_location\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the non-existent parameter \"include_graphical_analysis\" in its function call to TaxPolicyImpactSimulator, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only \"simulation_scenario\" was expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported parameters (\"pattern_detection\", \"include_visualization\", \"focus_on_physical_training\") in the function call instead of only passing the \"training_routine_data\" parameter as required, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"include_demographic_info\" in the AudienceSegmentationTool function call instead of matching the expected parameters exactly, causing a mismatch with the available tool schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"include_weekend_rules\" to the DailyTrafficRuleNotifier function call; only \"area_code\" is expected, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"consider_temperature\" in the function call, deviating from the expected function signature which only requires the \"city\" parameter. This caused a mismatch and failure to call the function properly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the analysis flags (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true, while the expected call required all these flags to be false."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unsupported parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") to the OceanicBiodiversityData_fetch function call, instead of using only the required \"zone_identifier\", resulting in a parameter mismatch with the available tool's expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the required parameter value \"Amazon rainforest\" for area_identifier, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to fail to recognize the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_44", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the relevant FinanceLectureBookingAssistant tool to book the seats, instead replying with follow-up questions in natural language and not using the required function-calling format."}

{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent used \"Technology\" (capitalized) instead of \"technology\" (lowercase) for the \"industry\" parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. The case difference prevented proper function call recognition."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent made the resetPassword call with incorrect parameters, using the wrong new password, security question, and answer instead of extracting or requesting the user's actual credentials as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to use any tool or function call to update the user profile, instead responding with a request for more information, despite already having sufficient details in the task to proceed with the \"updateUserProfile\" function."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to recognize that the user's request was to compute shipping costs rather than retrieve payment preferences. It did not attempt or plan the appropriate function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"UserPreferredCategories\" as \"Sports\" instead of \"Sports Goods,\" causing the function call to not match the expected parameters and resulting in a failure to satisfy the evaluator's requirement for exact argument matching."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent invented and used extra, unrequested parameters (\"userPreferredLoginTime\":\"CST\", \"loginFrequency\":\"Weekly\", \"previousPurchaseCategories\") instead of matching the expected parameter values (\"Evening\", \"Daily\") and ignored the correct password format, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated the user's email to \"jessica_newemail@personal.com\" instead of retaining the correct \"jessica.l@example.com\" as specified, and changed \"a town near Austin, TX\" to \"Near Austin, TX,\" leading to a mismatch with expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted \"UserPreferredCategories\" as \"Books, Wellness\" instead of the expected single category \"Wellness,\" causing a mismatch with the required parameters and leading to the function call not being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Platinum\" for the UserMemberStatus parameter instead of the expected \"Bronze,\" leading to a mismatch in the function call arguments and thus evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_20", "analysis": "The agent called fetchUserPreferences instead of directly using calculateShippingCost with the provided package size, shipping method, and membership status, failing to address the user's request to determine express delivery cost."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to extract and use the relevant information from context and did not invoke the required updateUserProfile function. Instead, it incorrectly asked the user for details that were already implicitly provided, producing no function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but supplied the wrong dietary preference (\"Shellfish-Free\" instead of the expected \"Gluten-Free\"), indicating it failed to align the menu update with the user's actual profile or specified allergies."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent's function call capitalized \"Mexican Meal\" instead of using \"Mexican meal\" as in the expected parameters, causing a mismatch in the exact function argument and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile function and instead attempted to collect further information conversationally, resulting in no tool calls being made as expected for updating user details."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"OrderName\" with different casing (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and thus no matching function call was found. The agent failed to normalize case for function parameters as required."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent used the restaurant name \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of the correct \"small burger place by the elm park\" as expected, causing a mismatch in the function call parameters and failing the test."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in the UserDietaryPreference argument, which did not match the expected parameters, leading to a failure to match the function call. The agent should have only used \"Gluten-Free\" as specified in the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect parameter name \"OrderName\" (capitalized \"N\") instead of the expected \"OrderName\" in all lowercase (\"dinner order\"), resulting in no exact match with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and unnecessarily included \"UserDietaryPreference\" in the parameters, which should have been omitted or set to null per the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the correct \"sushi order,\" causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent failed to include required fields \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus\" in the submitReview call, omitting key user context explicitly requested in the prompt and expected by the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent used \"Kimchi Palace\" as the restaurant name instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" specified by the user, resulting in incorrect arguments for the addMenuItem function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required Amount parameter in the processRefund call and used an incorrect UserRefundPreference (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\"), leading to a function call mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Nut-Free\" for UserDietaryPreference instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align the function call parameters with both the menu item name and the user's implied dietary need in the original request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile tool and instead responded with a generic conversational message, missing the necessary function invocation to update the user's home location as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed multiple dietary preferences as a single concatenated string (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") instead of providing just one valid preference (\"Vegetarian\") as required by the tool parameter specification."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary \"details\" argument (with \"cuisineType\": \"Japanese\") to the function call, making its request not match the expected schema for CulturalNormsExplorer_getEtiquetteGuidelines, which requires only \"country\" and \"context\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter when invoking ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and causing the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter to the DataGuard_encryptBusinessData function call, causing a schema mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator failing to recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter in the MuseumExplorer_getExhibitInfo function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"analysisPeriod\" parameter in the function call to SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" for location instead of the expected \"Paris,\" causing a mismatch in the function call parameters and resulting in failure to match the expected function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature, and thus the output did not match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in the function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, leading to a mismatch with the expected function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected function signature and led to the evaluator not recognizing the call as valid. Only the required demographic filters should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of just \"Tokyo,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters, which specified only the city name \"Tokyo.\" This led to the evaluator not recognizing the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter when calling TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch. The function call was missing this key field, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call structure and parameters but did not use the correct property names (\"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\"); this mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the output as the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"Finance Department\" (capitalized) for targetGroup instead of the expected \"finance department\" (lowercase), resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented correct function execution. Consistent parameter casing was required."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature, which only accepts \"task_name\" and \"priority\" for each task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent wrapped its JSON tool call output in an invalid XML-like <tool_call> tag, breaking JSON parsing. The function call structure and parameters were otherwise correct, but the extra markup caused a parsing failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"influence\" argument in its function call, which was not part of the expected parameters for the cultural_event_classical_music_impact tool, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call schema and causing the evaluator to reject it as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent emitted tool call output that was not valid JSON, likely due to improper serialization (missing closing characters, extraneous markup, or invalid wrapping), causing the function call to be unparseable and resulting in evaluation failure."}

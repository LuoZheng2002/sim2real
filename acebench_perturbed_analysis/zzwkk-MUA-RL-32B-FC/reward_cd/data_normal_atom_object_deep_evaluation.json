{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"time_restrictions\" with explicit \"time_range\" values (09:00-17:00), instead of simply listing the days as required. This caused the function call arguments to mismatch the expected format, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sample IDs and did not nest all parameters under the required \"monumentDetails\" key, resulting in a function call with incorrect schema that did not match the tool's expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"feedback_options\" argument to the publicSpeaking_coach function call, which does not match the function's expected signature. Only \"session_details\" should have been included, resulting in no match and execution failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent submitted \"all platforms\" for the safety app's availability instead of the specific required value \"iOS, Android, Web\" as requested, causing the function call arguments to not match the benchmark's strict expectations."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" (user's wording) to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" causing a parameter mismatch and failing to produce the expected function call signature required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the gear information outside the \"hikingDetails\" object in the function call payload, whereas the expected schema required \"gear\" to be nested within \"hikingDetails\". This structural mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required CommunityAidCenter_manageCollectionPoints function after receiving all necessary details, instead unnecessarily asked for a capacity not requested by the task or required by the tool, resulting in no tool call being made."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} dictionary for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema. The function arguments must match the expected structure exactly, even if some fields are empty."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only generated a function call for \"Direct\" employment, omitting the required separate call for \"Indirect\" employment. Both were requested in the user query, so the analysis is incomplete."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested the \"time\" parameter inside the \"customer\" object and included an unnecessary empty \"complianceRules\" array, resulting in function calls that did not match the expected parameter structure for GeoCompliance_verifyCustomerLocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in its function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the available \"content_moderation_analysis\" tool's required parameters and leading to no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator."}

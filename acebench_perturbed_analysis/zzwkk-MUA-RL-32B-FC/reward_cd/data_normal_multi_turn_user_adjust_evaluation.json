{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to execute the required DecisionAudit_submitReview function call with the provided comments and approval status, instead only retrieving the decision details. It did not submit the user's audit review as instructed."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the year 2023 in the dateRange instead of 2024, failing to use the correct year based on the user's upcoming travel plans. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_Budget instead of the lower-cost PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback tool, failing to match the expected function name and parameters required for the analysis of John Doe's most recent feedback."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent's response used <tool_call> tags instead of the required <function_call> tags for tool invocation, resulting in the evaluator not detecting any valid function calls and failing the test case."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema. The function name and parameter structure were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles to define roles, instead of using securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl to assign roles with their permissions and enable audit as required by the task. It failed to select the correct function for configuring access control."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the word \"to\" in the reviewReason field (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the user's provided reason (\"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\" in the function call to manage_feedback_collection, which was not expected. This caused the function call arguments to not match the expected schema, leading to the evaluator rejecting the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent placed the insuranceOptions field at the wrong nesting level in the function arguments; it should be inside rentalOptions, not as a top-level parameter, resulting in a non-matching function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The function arguments provided by the agent exactly match the expected values, but the order of items within the \"repaymentOptions\" array for \"Bank A\" differs. The evaluator likely enforces strict ordering, and the agent failed to preserve the expected sequence."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"location\" parameter to \"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of the expected \"Trastevere,\" causing a mismatch with the tool's parameter requirements and resulting in no valid function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct restaurant name (\"Traditional Italian Trattoria\") and location (\"near the Colosseum\") as specified by the user, instead sending generic/derived values (\"Trattoria near Colosseum\" and \"Rome\"), leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called only the leader type validation function instead of invoking TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate to compute innovation rates for teams with transformational leaders, failing to perform the main analytical task requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the correct team names by returning \"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\" as required, causing its function call arguments to not match the expected output format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the specifically required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, thus failing to perform the requested comparison between the two leaders as required by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The model included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string instead of \"breakfast\" as expected, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the function call exactly to the benchmark's required output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function name \"schedule_meeting,\" but failed to include the required \"parameters\" wrapper around the arguments in its tool call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a budget of $100-$200 for booking accommodation instead of the user's specified budget of $1000-$2000, failing to carry forward the correct user preferences in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance_cost value ($115.25) instead of the correct total ($120.5) as specified from the provided insurance options, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included updates to both the communicationModule and the impactAnalysisModule, instead of only modifying the communicationModule to change \"method\" to \"Email\" as requested; it made unnecessary modifications beyond the user's instruction."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters: it did not include existing_conditions for each traveler (should default to empty lists) and did not specify the duration within coverage_options, leading to a function call mismatch with the expected input structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the desired_qualities parameter as \"10+ years industry experience\" instead of matching the user's input and expected format \"10 years of industry experience,\" resulting in a mismatch that prevented function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" outside of \"user_preferences\" and used all-uppercase destination_ids (\"PARIS\", \"TOKYO\") instead of the expected capitalized form (\"Paris\", \"Tokyo\"), resulting in a function call argument structure mismatch with the expected schema."}

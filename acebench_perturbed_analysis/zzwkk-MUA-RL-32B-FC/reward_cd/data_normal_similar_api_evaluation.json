{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent called baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to use the more relevant tool that focuses on persistent vein visibility and associated symptoms as specified in the question and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent's function call used the \"temperature_range\" value \"18-25\" instead of the required \"18 to 25,\" causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call had parameter values that did not match the expected schema (e.g., field names and values for customer demographics, competitor analysis phrasing, business goals format, and evaluation criteria keys), causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent included extra detail in the function argument (\"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\") instead of using the required keyword \"AI control\" for the conflict_element parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the \"task_schedule_b\" function instead of the required \"task_schedule_a\" function, and also failed to match the expected parameter format, particularly for the new task's priority and resource fields."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function arguments paraphrased or shortened some values (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy\") and failed to exactly match the required parameter values from the expected answer, leading to a mismatch in function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the \"syntax_parsing_b\" function instead of \"syntax_parsing_a\", failing to follow the established usage pattern from the previous turn and disregarding the correct tool assignment based on the instruction and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"medium build\" for body_type instead of the expected \"medium\" string, causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent formatted its tool call incorrectly by putting all arguments within the \"name\" field as a method signature, instead of using the required \"arguments\" or \"parameters\" structure to specify input values for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call used an insufficiently detailed problem description, omitting relevant troubleshooting steps and context provided in the conversation. This failed to match the expected call, which required a comprehensive, contextual description to gather diverse perspectives effectively."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b. It failed to use the correct function for further evaluation, despite the user's follow-up request and the availability of the appropriate tool, analyze_social_data_b."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used the relation label \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker,\" included extra detail in the \"status\" field (\"causing tension\"), and used slightly incorrect argument formatting, leading to a mismatch with the evaluator's strict function call comparison."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent slightly misphrased the \"current_brand_status\" parameter as \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of the required \"not well-known,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent correctly selected the med_aiArticleGen tool with appropriate parameters, but output format issues (likely the use of <tool_call> XML-like tags instead of the expected JSON array/object structure) prevented correct function call extraction by the evaluator."}

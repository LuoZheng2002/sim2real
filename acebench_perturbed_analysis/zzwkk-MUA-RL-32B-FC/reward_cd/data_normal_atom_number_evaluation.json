{"id": "normal_atom_number_5", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"connectionType\" parameter (\"Wi-Fi\") in the SmartHomeDeviceIntegration function call, instead of only providing the required \"deviceID\" parameter as specified by the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in its function call, which does not match the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call despite correct tool and other parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent formatted the ageGroup as a range (20-30) instead of an integer, violating the expected JSON format and causing a parsing error. The tool expects a single integer value for ageGroup, not a range."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"riskAppetite\" parameter in the function call to TechStockInsightGenerator, resulting in no exact function signature match with the expected/available tool, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent only included \"industrialOutput\" in its function call, omitting \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment\" parameters that were required based on the original question, resulting in an incomplete function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"includeDocumentaries\" parameter in the function call, causing it not to match the expected function signature and leading to evaluator rejection. It should have used only \"startDecade\" and \"endDecade\" as parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent supplied an unrealistically low \"receptionDelay\" value (10 instead of the expected 1200), failing to either ask the user for this key information or make a reasonable default assumption about message delay duration."}

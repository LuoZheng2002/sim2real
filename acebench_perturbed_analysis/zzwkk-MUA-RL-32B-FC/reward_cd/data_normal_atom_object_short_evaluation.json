{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"emotion_depth\" in the function call to poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the exact expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The model added unsupported and extraneous arguments (\"tilt\", \"safety_checks\", \"adjustment_time\") to the adjust_seat_safety function call instead of strictly following the tool's expected parameter schema, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter (\"printTime\": \"medium\") in the function call to artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent made the correct API call but used \"pop\" (lowercase) for the genre instead of the expected \"Pop\" (capitalized), causing a parameter mismatch and leading to no matching function call found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"intensity\" field to the \"checkParameters\" argument, causing a schema mismatch with the expected function signature and preventing successful function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call to CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected input schema and causing no matching function call to be found."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio recording with one intensity, instead of handling all three recordings with their specified correction intensities as requested in the user prompt. It failed to make separate function calls for each recording-intensity pair."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with appropriate arguments, but used the year format \"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\" for the Colosseum date, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent made only a single call to hospital_record_fetch_Budget without specifying patient IDs or date ranges, instead of making four separate hospital_record_fetch calls with the correct parameters for each patient and hospitalization period as required."}

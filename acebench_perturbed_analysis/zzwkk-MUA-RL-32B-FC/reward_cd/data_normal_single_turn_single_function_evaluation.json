{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent's function call capitalized beneficiary names and relationships instead of using the expected lowercase format. This argument casing mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The model included time values with full timestamps (\"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z\") instead of the expected date-only format (\"2023-05-01\"), causing the function call arguments not to match the required schema exactly."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used \"sourceId\": \"techdataapi\" instead of the required \"sourceId\": \"1\" for the dataSources argument, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The failure was caused by mismatched time formats in the \"start\" and \"end\" fields (\"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\" vs \"2024-01-15T00:00:00\"), resulting in the agent's function call not matching the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but generated incorrect or hallucinated values for campaign title, dates (used 2024 instead of 2023), and age range max (30 instead of 35), failing to match the required parameters in the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in its function call to AccountManager_verifyDocument, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the function call to not be recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature despite otherwise correct extraction of features and species information."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted essential parameters (\"historical\" and \"source_id\" fields) in the traffic_data argument of the function call, resulting in a call that does not match the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize it as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent used a generic placeholder (\"Provided base64 encoded string\") for the imageData parameter instead of passing the actual input string provided by the user, causing a mismatch with the expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Free Play\" activity required in the routine, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not fully satisfy the user's request and failed to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_52", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the tool call JSON inside an extra non-standard <tool_call>...</tool_call> tag, producing output that was not valid JSON and causing a parsing failure. The function call should be emitted as raw JSON only."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_54", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call because it capitalized the industry parameter as \"Software\" instead of the expected lowercase \"software\". This parameter casing mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent's function call failed due to a casing mismatch in the \"teaName\" field (\"Green Tea\" vs. \"green tea\"), leading to no exact match with the expected parameters. This minor text deviation prevented successful function call execution."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"readingLevel\": \"intermediate\" field to the userProfile argument, which is not expected based on the available tool's signature, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extra closing brace at the end of its tool call, resulting in a parsing error and preventing execution of the intended function."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"vibration_patterns\" alongside \"app_details\" in the call arguments, instead of nesting \"vibration_patterns\" inside \"app_details\" per the expected function schema, resulting in a structural mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent specified the end time as \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the required \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"timeFrame\" parameter in the ConversationManager_linkMessages function call, which is not part of the function's expected parameters, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as a non-match."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"process_info\" field within the \"details\" structure of the function call, resulting in a parameters mismatch with the expected format and causing the call not to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the siteId as \"GreatWall_Beijing\" instead of \"Great Wall Beijing\", causing the function call parameters to not match exactly with the expected format. This mismatch led to an evaluator failure in function call recognition."}

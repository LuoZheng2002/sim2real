{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer function call instead of matching the expected signature, which only accepts \"text\" and \"context\" with \"culture\"; this caused the function call to not match and be rejected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected schema and resulting in the call being invalid for the evaluator. Only the required parameters should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and unsupported details (“details” field) within the protocol argument for DeviceConnection_authenticateBluetooth, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input schema and was therefore not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used a lowercase \"pop\" for the genre instead of the required capitalized \"Pop,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"intensity\" in the function call's checkParameters, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected input schema, which only accepts the \"timeFrame\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter to the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, which was not part of the expected API specification, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function execution."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"features\" field as an empty list in the simulation_parameters, causing the function call arguments to not match the expected schema for stellar_evolution_simulator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio recording with \"light\" intensity and ignored the other two files and intensities, failing to submit all three required function calls—one per recording and specified intensity."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent provided nearly correct function calls but formatted the year \"100 AD\" as \"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\" in the specificDate parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format for historical dates."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for tasks that should have been combined into a single call to WebSecurity_EncryptionManager with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters included together."}

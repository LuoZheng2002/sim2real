{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize and accurately aggregate the symptoms: it split \"crying a lot\" into \"crying a lot\" and \"decreased appetite\" instead of combining them as \"constant crying and decreased appetite,\" and missed using the canonical \"excessive crying.\" This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent returned a tool call with extra XML-like tags (<tool_call>...</tool_call>), causing invalid JSON output. It also failed to match required value normalizations (e.g., business goal wording, criteria simplification), but the main error was malformed tool call formatting."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent unnecessarily rephrased the required \"conflict_element\" from \"AI control\" to \"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities,\" resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used task_schedule_b instead of task_schedule_a, and its function call parameters did not match the required schema (wrong priority label, field names, and structure), failing to conform to the established convention from prior context."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly altered or paraphrased the slot values (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy\"), causing its function call not to match the expected canonical parameter values, resulting in a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the syntax_parsing_b tool instead of syntax_parsing_a, despite the expected and previously used function being syntax_parsing_a, which matches the task and parameters required."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent provided \"medium build\" instead of the required \"medium\" for the body_type parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"activity_level\" parameter in the function call to \"health_tips_a,\" which was not expected or supported. It should have only passed \"preferences\" and \"age,\" matching the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call argument was too terse, merely restating the initial problem without integrating prior context or expanding on the user's troubleshooting steps and need for diverse perspectives, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected detailed input."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent called analyze_social_data_a instead of the required analyze_social_data_b tool, and also submitted the wrong evaluation metrics (should only include \"F1 score\"), failing to use the correct function and parameters as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" argument in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, which is not accepted by the tool specification; only \"responsive_design\" and \"load_speed\" are valid parameters. This caused a mismatch with the evaluator's expectations."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent produced the correct function call but used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\", included an extra phrase (\"causing tension\") in the \"status\" field, and altered the field formatting, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameter schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly modified the \"theme\" parameter to \"The importance of love\" instead of matching the required \"importance of love,\" leading to a function call signature mismatch and failure to align with the expected output precisely."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent failed because it included unnecessary detail (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") in the current_brand_status parameter instead of matching the expected simplified value (\"not well-known\"), leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the \"title\" parameter value (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" instead of \"AI applications in oncology\"), leading to a mismatch with the strict parameter string expected by the evaluator."}

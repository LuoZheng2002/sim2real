{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required infrastructureResponse field in all function calls, failing to specify the necessary infrastructure actions for each vehicle as dictated by the task and expected output schema. Only raw vehicle data was included."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"date\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and evaluator rejection. All other parameters matched the requirements."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the parallel connection between the two resistors in the second circuit: it used generic labels (\"resistor\" to \"resistor\") instead of distinguishing the components (e.g., \"resistor1\" to \"resistor2\"), causing a parameter mismatch with expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent's function call for football_venue_management used \"description\": \"turf maintenance\" instead of the expected \"description\": \"Turf maintenance\" (case mismatch), causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a matching call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_60", "analysis": "The agent only submitted one function call for the first property instead of generating separate function calls for each of the five properties as requested, failing to process all the required foundation quality checks."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_65", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"other_elements\": [] field in the initial_composition argument for both function calls, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature despite supplying all other necessary information correctly."}

The function names and other fields were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_75", "analysis": "The agent output extra XML-like <tool_call> tags around the JSON tool calls, causing JSON parsing to fail due to invalid syntax. Tool calls should be emitted as pure JSON objects, not wrapped in non-JSON markup."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"reverb\" effect's intensity to 0.9 instead of the expected maximum value of 1 and included unnecessary parameters \"apply_time\": \"non-real-time\" in the audio_effect_processor call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_80", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"secondary\" key in the \"fonts\" object, deviating from the expected schema, and output double closing curly braces, resulting in malformed JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_81", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in both function calls. This caused its function call signatures not to match the expected tool usage, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_84", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON for the HomeLightingControl_manageLightSettings call by incorrectly nesting the \"settings\" field as a list instead of an object, causing an extra closing bracket and a parsing error. This made the tool call unparsable."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_85", "analysis": "The agent attempted to encode multiple function calls as a single invalid JSON object, repeating \"name\" and \"arguments\" fields instead of outputting separate JSON objects or array entries for each call, resulting in a malformed response that could not be parsed."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_86", "analysis": "The agent produced an invalid JSON for the CaseDocumentManager_uploadLegalDocument tool call by including an extra closing curly brace, resulting in a parse error.

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the resetPassword tool despite having enough contextual information to proceed, instead asking the user for details that should have been inferred or assumed available from the initial instructions. No tool call was made."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile tool and instead responded with a text-based clarification request, missing the expected tool invocation to update the user's profile as instructed."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to recognize the user’s request was to compute shipping cost rather than retrieve privacy settings. It misunderstood the task intent and selected the wrong tool entirely."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sports\" instead of the more specific \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories in the addToCart function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for \"password\" and \"userPreferredLoginTime\" and omitted the required \"loginFrequency\" parameter, resulting in an incomplete and mismatched function call to loginUser."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to accurately extract and preserve the specific details in the user's request: it incorrectly generalized \"a town near Austin, TX\" to \"Near Austin, TX\" and did not use the provided more personal email address \"jessica.l@example.com,\" instead inventing \"jessica.personal@example.com.\""}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included both \"Books\" and \"Wellness\" in UserPreferredCategories instead of only \"Wellness,\" causing a mismatch with the expected arguments and resulting in a function signature misalignment."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent only provided the updated home location and omitted all other required user profile fields in the updateUserProfile call, failing to include necessary parameters like UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent included \"inches\" in the \"PackageDimensions\" parameter instead of just the numeric string \"12x8x10\", causing a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to take action by not invoking the updateUserProfile tool; instead, it requested information from the user despite the details being implicitly available, missing the opportunity to perform the required updates via a function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to correctly extract the user's actual member status (\"Silver\") from the context, defaulting to \"Standard\" instead. This led to an incorrect parameter in the calculateShippingCost function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent used \"Shellfish-Free\" as the dietary preference for updating the menu item instead of \"Gluten-Free,\" which is what was specified in the user's profile or expected output, indicating a failure to correctly align with the user's actual dietary needs."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"Mexican Meal\" instead of the expected \"Mexican meal\" for the OrderName parameter, causing a casing mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated the email to \"jessica.new@example.com\" and password to \"Jessie90#new\" instead of using the provided \"jessica.l@example.com\" and \"Jessie90#\". It invented new values rather than using those specified by the user."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The model failed because it used \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized) for OrderName instead of the expected \"dinner order\" (lowercase), causing a strict evaluator mismatch despite correct function choice and parameter values otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" alongside \"Gluten-Free\" in the UserDietaryPreference argument, instead of only passing \"Gluten-Free\" as required. This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"OrderName\" as \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected \"dinner order,\" causing an exact string mismatch that led to the evaluator's failure to recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and included an unnecessary parameter (\"UserDietaryPreference\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMembershipStatus\" parameter and set \"UserDietaryPreferences\" as an empty list instead of including \"None\" as expected. It also slightly altered the review text, failing to match expectations exactly."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required \"addMenuItem\" tool and instead unnecessarily requested clarification about the restaurant name, ignoring that \"my favorite Korean joint\" sufficed per the task specification. No function call was made as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the mandatory \"Amount\" parameter in the processRefund call and incorrectly used \"UserRefundPreference\" as \"Original Method\" instead of the expected value \"Store Credit,\" failing to properly extract and map required details from the user profile or context."}

{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") into a single string for the UserDietaryPreference parameter, instead of providing only \"Vegetarian\" as expected by the addMenuItem function schema."}

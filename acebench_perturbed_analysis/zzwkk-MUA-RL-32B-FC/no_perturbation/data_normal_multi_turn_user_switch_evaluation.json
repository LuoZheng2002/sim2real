{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary and unsupported \"details\" field with \"cuisineType\" in the function call. The tool only accepts \"country\" and \"context\", so the call did not match the expected schema and was not recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the period at the end of the document text (\"Confidential Business Strategy.\") when passing it to the encryption function, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, leading to a mismatch with the expected input and resulting in no matching function call found."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter, which caused its function call not to match the expected input, leading to evaluation failure. All other arguments were correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"France\" in the location parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of just \"Paris\", resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected parameter format required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" for location instead of the expected \"Paris,\" causing a strict parameter mismatch and resulting in the function call not being recognized as valid by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (translationFeatures and timeOptions) in the function call to CulturalTranslator_translateInteraction, instead of using only the accepted parameters (sourceLanguage, targetLanguage, content, contentType), resulting in no match with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in its function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. The omission of this key parameter caused the test failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_28_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"method\" field (\"standard biodegradable wrapping\") to the elements of the \"packagingOptions\" array, deviating from the expected schema which only required the \"material\" field, causing a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"securityOptions\" at the top-level of the function call instead of nesting it within each customer's data object, resulting in a non-matching function signature and failure to match the expected structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The model included an extra, unsupported argument (\"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\") in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the model’s output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of just \"Tokyo\" as required by the function signature, causing a mismatch and resulting in the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with the correct posts but used the wrong parameter for analysisDepth (\"detailed\" instead of the required \"basic\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to process the request as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The essential root cause is the agent used \"details\" value with different capitalization (\"valuation summary...\" instead of \"Valuation summary...\"), resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected parameters and failing the strict match required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong value for the primary color, outputting \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of the expected \"#00FF00\" (the more standard bright green) as specified or implied by the benchmark, resulting in a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature for cultural_tour_experience. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the model's output as a correct match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"influence\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the required schema for the cultural_event_classical_music_impact tool, leading to the function call being rejected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"required\" field in the function call arguments, deviating from the expected schema, which caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching despite otherwise correct content."}

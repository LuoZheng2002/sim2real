{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent failed to nest all relevant parameters under the required \"votingContext\" key in its function arguments, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included explicit time ranges (\"00:00-23:59\") for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" field, whereas the expected format only required specifying the days without any time ranges. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix from the sampleIDs in its function call and failed to wrap both monumentID and materialSamples within a monumentDetails object, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"feedback_options\" parameter alongside \"session_details\" in its function call, resulting in a payload that did not match the expected signature for the publicSpeaking_coach tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The model's function call used \"all platforms\" instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" for the safety app's availability, failing to match the strict parameter format required by the API and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"capacity\" parameter in the function call, which is not defined in the expected schema for GlobalCulturalEventPlanner, causing the function call to not match and fail validation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, which caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and led to no match being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent used a different meeting topic (\"New Product Launch Discussion\") instead of the required wording (\"Launch of our new product\"), causing the function call not to exactly match the expected parameters and resulting in a failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information outside the \"hikingDetails\" object; according to the function schema, \"gear\" should be a field inside \"hikingDetails.\" This schema mismatch caused the function call to be unmatched and thus failed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The model outputted the function call in a non-standard format (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\") rather than as a structured JSON object in the expected function call format, causing the evaluator to not match it as a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent improperly wrapped each tool call JSON in an XML-like <tool_call> tag and included trailing curly braces, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. The tool call format was not adhered to."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the required parameter structure for MarketDashboard_createInteractiveDashboard."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only generated a function call for direct employment, omitting the required separate call for indirect employment analysis as requested, thus failing to analyze both aspects of employment impact as the question specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" parameter at the top level of the function call instead of nesting it inside the \"customer\" object as required by the expected function schema, resulting in schema mismatch and unmatched calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in the content_moderation_analysis function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator failing to recognize the call as valid."}

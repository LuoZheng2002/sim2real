{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent included an extra argument \"include_legal_requirements\" not supported by the ExportRegulationAdvisor function, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature. Only \"export_category\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_6", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra, unsupported parameter \"warranty_check\" in the function call, which does not match the expected function signature and thus caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input schema for TimeManagementAssistant_designSchedule. This caused the call to not be recognized as valid by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters \"include_attachment\" and \"encryption_level\" in its function call, failing to provide all necessary information for sending an encrypted email as specified by the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"provide_indoor_options\" parameter, which was not part of the expected function signature or required by the input, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the HikingWeatherAdvisor tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter, \"include_graphical_analysis,\" in its function call to TaxPolicyImpactSimulator, which was not expected or supported, causing the function call to mismatch the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"pattern_detection\" argument to the EliteTennisTrainingPatterns function call, deviating from the required parameters and causing schema mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"include_demographic_info\") in the AudienceSegmentationTool call that is not part of the tool's specification, causing the function call to not match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_30", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"accuracy_threshold\" parameter to the SignalAccuracyEvaluator function call, violating the required parameter schema and causing a mismatch with the expected function signature. Only the \"device_id\" key was valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent added an extra unsupported parameter \"consider_temperature\" to the ClothingRecommendationBasedOnWeather function call, which does not match the expected function signature that only requires the \"city\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, and include_device_usage parameters to true instead of the expected false values, resulting in a parameter mismatch and a failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of \"Amazon rainforest\" for the area_identifier parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in failure to properly fulfill the required task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required parameter \"include_indoor_suggestions\" in the WeekendWeatherChecker function call, omitting a necessary boolean argument and thus not matching the expected function signature."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and parameters but used the year 2023 instead of the correct upcoming year 2024 for the specified March 8 to March 22 date range. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"feedbackId\" parameter (\"most-recent\") in the function call, providing only the \"employeeId.\" This resulted in a function call mismatch with the expected output, which specified both parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles to define roles but failed to use securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, which is required to assign specific permissions and enable audit trails as requested in the task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the article \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" field (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of using the exact phrasing given by the user (\"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Trastevere, Rome\" as the location instead of just \"Trastevere\" as required by the function signature, resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented the function call from being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the insuranceOptions field inside the top-level arguments instead of nesting it within rentalOptions as required by the function signature, leading to a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly treated \"Trattoria da Enzo\" as the restaurant to book, likely hallucinating a specific restaurant name, instead of following the user's request to book \"a traditional Italian trattoria near the Colosseum,\" as specified in the user's preferences."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call JSON with invalid extra closing braces and misplaced XML-like tags (<tool_call>...</tool_call>), resulting in a JSON parsing error. It failed to produce a clean, standalone JSON object as required for tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent called only the validation function instead of proceeding to calculate innovation rates using TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate for teams with transformational leaders, thus failing to complete the main task requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in team names, outputting \"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\" in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected format and failure to generate the required report."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" in the updated communicationModule settings; only the \"method\" parameter should have been changed to \"Email,\" matching the user's request to change communication method but keep other settings unchanged."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call, but it mismatched the expected capitalization for the \"agenda\" parameter (\"finalize\" vs \"Finalize\"), causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching despite correct intent and information."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the extraneous \"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\" and \"form_title\": \"Travel Website Feedback\" parameters in the function call, which do not match the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string instead of matching the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast.\" This slight wording difference caused the function call arguments to not exactly match the expected parameters, resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"activityLevel\" field in the \"touristPreferences\" parameter, deviating from the expected argument schema for the function call. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong insurance cost ($110.0) instead of the expected option ($120.5) when calculating the total travel budget, failing to choose the insurance option that matches the one with all requested coverages."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (including \"algorithm\": \"demand-driven\" and \"forecasting\": true) in its function call to travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals, leading to a mismatch with the expected API usage."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent listed the \"repaymentOptions\" for Bank A's debt in the wrong order (\"lump sum\" first, \"installments\" second), while the expected output requires \"installments\" listed before \"lump sum\". This mismatch caused the function call comparison to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in its function call: both \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and \"duration\" in \"coverage_options\" were missing, leading to a mismatch with the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly rephrased the desired quality \"10 years of industry experience\" as \"10+ years industry experience\" in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}

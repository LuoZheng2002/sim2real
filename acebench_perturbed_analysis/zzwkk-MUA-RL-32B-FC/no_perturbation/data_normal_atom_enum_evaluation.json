{"id": "normal_atom_enum_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the parameter values \"Moderate\" and \"Dynamic\" instead of using the expected lowercase \"moderate\" and \"dynamic,\" causing a mismatch in function call argument values and leading to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool and parameters but incorrectly set \"outputDetail\" to \"Detailed\" instead of the required \"Summary\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_30", "analysis": "The agent used \"Comprehensive\" instead of the required \"Detailed\" value for the detailLevel parameter, resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected schema and thus was not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_37", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"weatherDetail\": \"Summary\" in its function call, which does not match the expected function signature that only requires \"airportCode\" and \"flightNumber\"—leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter when calling GameFinder_analyzeUserInterestForGames, failing to filter recommendations by game rating as explicitly requested in the user's query."}

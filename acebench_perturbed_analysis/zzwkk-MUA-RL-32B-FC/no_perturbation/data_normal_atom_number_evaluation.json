{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the specific age 25 instead of the requested age range 20-30; it should have selected the lower bound (20) as required by the tool, leading to a mismatch in function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"radius\" parameter in the FindNearbyMedicineDisposal function call, rather than only the required \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" parameters, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"similarityScore\" when calling ContentSimilarityAnalyzer, even though the tool only requires \"novelContent\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent only included the \"industrialOutput\" parameter in its function call, omitting the required \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment\" parameters requested in the original question, resulting in an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent used an unrealistically short \"receptionDelay\" value (30) instead of the expected, much higher value (1200), likely due to failing to clarify or infer the actual delay the user was experiencing before calling the MessageReceptionChecker function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, deviating from the expected parameters. This caused a mismatch with the tool's defined interface, leading to evaluation failure."}

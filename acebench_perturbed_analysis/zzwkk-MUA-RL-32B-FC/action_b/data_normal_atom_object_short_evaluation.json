{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature, which only required \"text\" and \"context\" (with \"culture\")."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"tilt\", \"safety_checks\", \"adjustment_time\") to the function call instead of only adjusting the requested \"tilt\" in the seat position, causing the function call to not match the available tool's expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"printTime\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the expected parameters for artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary \"details\" steps within the \"protocol\" argument, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameter schema. Only \"type\" and \"time\" keys were expected for \"protocol\", causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The model specified the genre as \"pop\" in lowercase, while the expected parameter was \"Pop\" with an uppercase \"P\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call. Only the \"timeFrame\" parameter was required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"eventTypes\" parameter to the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, which was not part of the expected or supported arguments, causing a mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extraneous \"features\" field with an empty list in the simulation_parameters, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected schema and failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed the first audio file with \"light\" correction, ignoring the other two recordings and correction intensities. It also included an irrelevant \"feedbackMode\" parameter, deviating from both the task and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent formatted the year for the Colosseum query as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required four-digit format \"0100-08-01,\" causing an exact parameter mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The model used natural language date formats (\"January 1, 2023\") in function arguments instead of the required ISO date format (\"2023-01-01\"), causing the function calls not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"dataOptions\" parameter in the function call, which did not match the expected schema for WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast, resulting in no valid function call being recognized."}

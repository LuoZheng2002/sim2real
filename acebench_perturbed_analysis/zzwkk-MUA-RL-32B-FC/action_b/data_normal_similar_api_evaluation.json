{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the tool specialized in persistent vein visibility with symptoms as described in the question."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The model outputted \"temperature_range\":\"18-25\" instead of the expected \"temperature_range\":\"18 to 25,\" failing to preserve the required string format for the temperature range, which caused the function call not to match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON by wrapping the function call in an unnecessary <tool_call> tag, violating the expected format for tool calls. This caused the evaluator to fail at parsing the response and prevented proper comparison or evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent provided an overly specific \"conflict_element\" (\"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\") instead of using the required concise parameter \"AI control,\" resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected input signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the \"task_schedule_b\" function instead of the required \"task_schedule_a\" and mismapped parameter names (\"priority\" as \"Urgent\" instead of \"High\", \"duration\" instead of \"estimated_time\", and different resource keys). It failed to follow function selection and parameter schema constraints."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent called vlookup_step_guide without providing the required parameters (lookup_value, table_array, column_index_number, range_lookup), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected specification for generating a relevant, contextualized step-by-step guide."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call used slightly paraphrased argument values (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy\"), which did not exactly match the expected strings, causing a strict evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected syntax_parsing_b instead of syntax_parsing_a for the French sentence, despite the sentence only containing ASCII characters and the context requiring syntax_parsing_a, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"medium build\" for body_type instead of the expected value \"medium\", causing a mismatch in function parameters and leading to no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the unsupported \"include_statistics\" parameter to the eco_vision_B function call, causing it not to match the expected function signature, which accepts only \"city_name\" and \"impact_areas\"."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"activity_level\" parameter in the call to health_tips_a instead of matching the tool signature by only using \"preferences\" and \"age\", resulting in a non-matching function call and failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call lacked detail, only repeating the basic problem statement instead of expanding upon it to include additional context and a request for diverse perspectives, which was required for the clarity_guide_b call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked the analyze_social_data_a function instead of analyze_social_data_b, failing to select the required tool despite both being available and functionally similar. The issue is improper tool selection, not parameter formatting or content."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called poetry_analysis_b instead of the required poetry_analysis_a function, failing to select the correct tool as specified by the task and available tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent output \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" and included extra commentary (\"causing tension\") in the \"status\" field, differing from the required exact parameters, which led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly expanded \"not well-known\" to \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" in the function parameter, failing to match the required parameter value and thus not triggering the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent used title case (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") for the \"title\" parameter instead of the expected lowercase (\"AI applications in oncology\"), resulting in a mismatch with the strict function call parameter matching required by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly flattened the parameters instead of nesting them within a \"votingContext\" object as required by the function specification, resulting in a mismatched function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unnecessary \"time_range\" fields to each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" array, instead of simply listing the days as required. This resulted in a function call parameter mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleID fields and failed to wrap the inputs inside the expected \"monumentDetails\" parameter, leading to an incorrect function call structure that does not match the tool's expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON for the tool call by including an extra closing brace, causing a parsing failure. This syntax error prevented the function call from being executed despite having the correct intent and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"feedback_options\" parameter and omitted the additional requested focus on \"speech structure,\" deviating from the expected function signature and parameters for publicSpeaking_coach. It also failed to remove unnecessary feedback options not present in the available tool schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed \"all platforms\" for the fireworks app availability instead of explicitly enumerating \"iOS, Android, Web\" as requested, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, deviating from the required schema. The tool only accepts \"current_mood\" and \"favorite_genres\" in \"user_preferences,\" causing a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent changed the meeting topic from \"launch of our new product\" (as specified) to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" which caused a parameter mismatch and resulted in the function call not matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the gear information as a top-level key in the function call instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function schema, leading to a mismatch in the expected parameters structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"capacity\" argument in the function call, causing a mismatch with the tool's required parameter schema and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent wrapped its JSON tool calls inside XML-like <tool_call> tags and included extra closing braces, resulting in invalid JSON output that could not be parsed, instead of outputting a plain JSON array of tool call objects as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format that requires \"settings\": {} explicitly, even when no settings are specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only generated an analysis for direct employment but failed to make a separate function call for indirect employment, as specified in the original request and required by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" value at the top level of the function call and included an unnecessary empty \"complianceRules\" array, instead of placing \"time\" inside the \"customer\" object as required by the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in its function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call. Only supported parameters should be used."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter (\"keyLength\": 256) to the DataGuard_encryptBusinessData function call, which did not match the expected parameter schema, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"analysisPeriod\" parameter (\"2023-12\") in its SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature. This omission caused the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided \"Paris, France\" for the location argument, while the tool expected just \"Paris\" as per the function signature. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent formatted the location parameter as \"Paris, France\" instead of \"Paris\" as required by the function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failure to recognize the function call. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"translationFeatures\" with \"idiomaticExpressions\", \"culturalInsights\", \"pronunciationAdjustments\") not required by the function signature, resulting in a non-matching function call. Only the basic required arguments should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in its CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output and causing the evaluation to fail."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The model included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" argument in the function call, which does not match the expected parameters for CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The model included \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of the expected \"Tokyo,\" causing a mismatch with the anticipated function call parameters and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly lowercased \"Valuation summary for properties involved\" in the integrationOptions.details field, making it \"valuation summary for properties involved\" instead of preserving the expected capitalization, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"estimated_time\" field in each task object, which is not part of the expected input schema for the goal_set_priority_tasks function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"Finance Department\" (title case) instead of \"finance department\" (lowercase) for the targetGroup parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call that required an exact lowercase string match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of the expected \"#00FF00\" (bright green) for the primary color, failing to accurately match the user's explicit color preference for green."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the tool call within an invalid XML-like tag (<tool_call>...</tool_call>), instead of as a plain JSON object, causing parsing failure of the function call. The core error is incorrect output formatting, not the function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"influence\" parameter ([\"opera\", \"symphony\"]) in its function call, which does not match the expected function schema, leading to a mismatch and failed function call recognition."}

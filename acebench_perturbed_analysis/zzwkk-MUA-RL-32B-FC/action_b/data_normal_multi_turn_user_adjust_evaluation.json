{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the year 2023 instead of the correct intended year 2024 for the provided date range, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous closing characters (an extra curly brace and tool_call tags) outside the JSON object in its tool call, resulting in invalid, unparsable JSON. The function call should have been output as a clean, standalone JSON object only."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", causing the function call parameters not to match and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted the required \"feedbackId\" parameter, which should have been set to \"most-recent\" as specified by the user. This incomplete argument list caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" property in the manage_feedback_collection function call, causing a schema mismatch and failure to match the expected tool invocation."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent included the word \"to\" in \"reviewReason\" (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of exactly matching the expected value \"ensure compliance,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"endDate\" instead of the required \"checkOutDate\" key within the stayDuration parameter for the hotel booking function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Rome\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Trastevere, Rome\") instead of just \"Trastevere\" as required by the function signature, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly ordered the \"repaymentOptions\" array for the \"Bank A\" debt. The expected output listed \"installments\" before \"lump sum\", but the agent reversed this order, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent hallucinated a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\") and included unnecessary details in the 'special_requests' field instead of following the user's preference for a generic \"traditional Italian trattoria near the Colosseum.\" It failed to match the expected parameter format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Trastevere cooking class venue\" as the destination instead of the correct \"Trastevere,\" failing to match the expected precise parameter value required for the function call. This caused the mismatch despite other parameters being correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked only the validation tool instead of calling the innovation rate calculation function. It failed to process the provided team metrics and generate the required innovation rates, thus not addressing the actual user request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" instead of \"Team Alpha\", \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Beta\") in the function call arguments, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string instead of matching the expected \"breakfast\". This minor but strict mismatch in the preferences parameter caused exact string comparison to fail."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the function call in an XML-like <tool_call> wrapper instead of the required structured format, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call despite correct parameters. This format mismatch led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect budget range ($100–$200 instead of the user-specified $1000–$2000) when calling the book_accommodation tool, failing to match the user's explicit budget preference and resulting in a mismatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unchanged impactAnalysisModule settings in the TechManager_modifyDeployment call, instead of updating only the specified communicationModule method from Slack to Email, as the user requested.

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect insurance cost ($115.25 instead of $120.5 per person as provided for the selected insurance option), indicating it failed to correctly extract and apply the referenced per-person insurance cost from the tool output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call: it did not provide \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and omitted the \"duration\" field in coverage_options, both of which are necessary according to the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the phrasing of the \"desired_qualities\" parameter from \"10 years of industry experience\" (expected) to \"10+ years industry experience\" (actual), causing an argument mismatch and failure to trigger the function per the evaluator's strict matching requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the parameters for the virtual_travel_guide function by nesting travel_dates under user_preferences instead of alongside it, and by using destination_id values with inconsistent casing (\"PARIS\", \"TOKYO\" instead of \"Paris\", \"Tokyo\"), causing a mismatch with the expected schema."}

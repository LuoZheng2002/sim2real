{"id": "normal_atom_enum_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"contactMethod\": \"Email\" parameter in its function call, failing to include all necessary details specified by the environment and expected output. This resulted in a mismatch between the actual and expected function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the values for \"investmentSize\" and \"marketDynamics\" (\"Moderate\", \"Dynamic\") instead of using the required lowercase (\"moderate\", \"dynamic\"), leading to a parameter mismatch that caused function call matching to fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"outputDetail\": \"Detailed\" instead of the expected \"outputDetail\": \"Summary\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct, despite other parameters being accurate."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_37", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"weatherDetail\" in the function call to FlightStatus_checkFlightAndWeather, instead of adhering to the expected parameters \"airportCode\" and \"flightNumber\" only. This caused the evaluator to reject the call as a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with the user's interest but omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter, failing to filter recommendations for good-rated games as explicitly requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the \"high rating\" requirement to a numeric value (\"4.5\") instead of the expected keyword \"high\" for the \"rating\" parameter, causing the function call to not match the expected format."}

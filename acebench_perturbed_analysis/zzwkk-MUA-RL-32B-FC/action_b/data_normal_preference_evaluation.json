{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to actually call the resetPassword function—it only described what it would do and asked for more details, despite all necessary information being available. It should have executed the function call directly as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the updateUserProfile tool as required, instead responding with a text-based clarification and summarization. It did not perform any function call, which was necessary to update the user's profile as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to recognize that the user's request was specifically about calculating shipping cost using the provided package dimensions, shipping method, and membership status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call arguments and resulting in evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent only attempted to update the preferred contact method and ignored the user's request to verify and potentially update the email address and home location, resulting in an incomplete updateUserProfile function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent added non-existent and incorrect parameters (\"userPreferredLoginTime\", \"loginFrequency\", \"previousPurchaseCategories\") to the loginUser call, and provided the wrong password. It failed to match the required function call schema with correct arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the user's email to \"jessica_newemail@personal.com\" instead of keeping the original \"jessica.l@example.com\", and paraphrased the location less precisely, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books, Sports\" instead of \"Wellness\" as expected, leading to a function call mismatch. It failed to align user preferences with the correct category in the addToCart parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the correct \"Bronze\" membership tier, failing to utilize the user's actual membership status benefit when invoking calculateShippingCost."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the updated home location, omitting other required user profile fields such as UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_preference_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to address the user's explicit request to compute shipping costs using provided package size, preferred express method, and membership status. It did not progress to the necessary function for the user's query."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the updateUserProfile tool and instead asked the user for missing details, despite the expected behavior being to update the user's profile with the provided (or inferred) information via a function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent used \"Mexican Meal\" (capitalized \"Meal\") instead of the expected \"Mexican meal\" for the OrderName parameter, causing the function call to not match exactly and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required updateUserProfile function and instead responded with a text-based message requesting input, omitting any tool use or function call tags as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The model's processPayment call used \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized) as the OrderName parameter, but the expected value was \"dinner order\" (lowercase), resulting in a mismatch and failure to find a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to accurately extract the restaurant's name from the user's request, generating \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of the correct \"small burger place by the elm park,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined two dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") instead of using only \"Gluten-Free\" as expected, resulting in a function call that did not match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model failed due to a mismatch in the case sensitivity of the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Dinner Order\" vs. expected \"dinner order\"), leading to no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an imprecise restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter, which should be null per the function signature and ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the expected \"sushi order\" for the OrderName parameter, resulting in a mismatch that caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus\" in the submitReview function call, despite the user explicitly requesting the loyalty status and mentioning dietary preferences. This led to a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the RestaurantName parameter, failing to preserve the user's explicit restaurant reference in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Amount\" parameter in the processRefund function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to process the refund as needed."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align the preference parameter with the menu item's specification mentioned in the request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the necessary function call (updateUserProfile) and instead responded conversationally, missing the required structured tool-use to update the user's home location as specified by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed a combined string \"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\" for UserDietaryPreference instead of the required single value \"Vegetarian,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call format."}

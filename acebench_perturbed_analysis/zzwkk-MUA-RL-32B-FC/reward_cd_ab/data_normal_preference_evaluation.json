{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent generated the reset password call using incorrect values for the new password, security question, and security answer, instead of using the updated credentials and information expected in the test case. This shows a failure to use the correct input data as specified."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke any tool or function, instead responding only with a message to the user. It should have called the \"UP\" function to update the user's profile, as all necessary information was already available."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to select the correct shipping cost calculation tool (SC) and instead called fetchUserPreferences, which does not perform shipping cost estimation. It did not extract or use the required parameters to fulfill the shipping cost calculation request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the user's preferred category as \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and no exact function call match with the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent included extra and incorrect parameters (\"userPreferredLoginTime\": \"CST\", \"loginFrequency\": \"Weekly\", \"previousPurchaseCategories\", and a wrong password) instead of using the required fields and correct values for a login action with the U tool."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent supplied a new email (\"jessica_newemail@example.com\") instead of updating to a more personal variation of the existing one (\"jessica.l@example.com\"). Additionally, the home location was not phrased as \"a town near Austin, TX\" as requested, leading to parameter mismatches."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Books, Wellness\" for \"UserPreferredCategories\" instead of only \"Wellness\" as expected. This mismatch caused the function call arguments to not match the required format, leading to evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required UserMemberStatus value \"Bronze\" in the SC function call, instead using \"Standard,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to issue any tool calls, instead requesting additional information from the user despite being provided with all required parameters in the character profile. It did not utilize the UP function as expected to update the user's profile."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's actual dietary preference (\"Gluten-Free\") and instead used \"Shellfish-Free\" in the MI tool call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"Mexican Meal\" instead of using the correct casing \"Mexican meal\" for the OrderName argument, causing a strict matching failure despite the function call being otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required UP tool and instead responded with a text message requesting more information, without issuing any function call or tool invocation as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected \"dinner order\" for the \"OrderName\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call. This caused the evaluator to reject the call despite other parameters being correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed because it altered the restaurant name to \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of using the correct entity \"small burger place by the elm park,\" resulting in a function call mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in UserDietaryPreference, which was not present in the expected input. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized \"Dinner Order\" instead of using the expected lowercase \"dinner order\" for the \"OrderName\" parameter, resulting in an exact match failure despite otherwise correct function selection and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included the user's dietary preference in the function call instead of leaving it null as specified in the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the expected \"sushi order\" for the OrderName argument, resulting in no match with the required function call parameters and causing the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent's function call to \"R\" omitted the required \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus\" fields in its arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature for successful review submission."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent used \"Kimchi Palace\" as the restaurant name instead of the correct \"My favorite Korean joint,\" failing to extract or match the user-specified location from the query, leading to a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the refund amount to 0 instead of 350, and selected \"Original Method\" instead of the user's preferred \"Store Credit,\" resulting in both parameter values not matching the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium\" as implied by the requested menu item, resulting in a function call that did not match the user's intended dietary preference."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the appropriate function (UP) to update the user's home location and instead responded conversationally, not invoking any tool call as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Gluten-Free\" as a UserDietaryPreference in the MI function call, whereas only \"Vegetarian\" was expected. This mismatch led to the function call not matching the evaluator’s criteria."}

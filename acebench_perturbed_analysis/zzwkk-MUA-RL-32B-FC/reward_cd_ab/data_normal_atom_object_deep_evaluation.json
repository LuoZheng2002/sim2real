{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"voterTurnoutFactors\" and \"votingMethods\" outside of the \"votingContext\" object in the function arguments, violating the required parameter schema for the CDA_VD tool. This led to no matching function call being found."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified detailed time ranges (\"00:00-23:59\") for each weekday in the time_restrictions instead of only listing the days as required. The function call arguments did not match the expected simpler structure, causing the evaluator to reject it."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call to H_A by passing 'monumentID' and 'materialSamples' as separate arguments instead of nesting them under the required 'monumentDetails' parameter as specified by the function schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extra closing brace at the end, making the tool call unparsable and causing the function execution to fail. Proper JSON formatting was not maintained in the output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"feedback_options\" in the S_C function call, which was not part of the expected parameters, resulting in a function signature mismatch and failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function GlobalCulturalEventPlanner_1 instead of GCEP, ignoring the available tool GCEP that matches the required function name and parameters, resulting in a failure to satisfy the test's function call expectations."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter to the M_E_P_G function call; only \"current_mood\" and \"favorite_genres\" are valid. This mismatch prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_20", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"frequency\" field (\"weekly\") in the \"retraining_schedule\" argument, which was not present in the expected function parameters, causing the function call to not match exactly with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" (as provided in the user's request) to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" failing to preserve the exact topic required in the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the gear information as a top-level parameter alongside hikingDetails instead of nesting it within hikingDetails as required by the AP_HP function schema, leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_25", "analysis": "The agent called CareerTrendAnalyzer_analyzeJobMarket_1 instead of the lower-cost, functionally equivalent CTA_JM, failing to select the correct tool as required by the updated user request and available options."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent returned tool call outputs wrapped in extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags and with additional closing braces, resulting in invalid JSON formatting that prevented correct parsing and evaluation, despite otherwise forming correct function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required empty \"settings\": {} object in the \"summary\" widget for the second MD_ID function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters and a failure to match the function call signature exactly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only made a single function call for \"Direct\" employment, omitting the required separate call for \"Indirect\" employment, thus failing to address both requested employment types as specified in the user query."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"time\" field at the top level instead of inside the \"customer\" object in its GC_CL function calls, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_44", "analysis": "The agent only made a single function call for the first function and ignored the other four required function analyses, failing to issue five separate calls as specified in the user instructions."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in its function call to C_M_A, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature that only accepts \"content\" and \"context\" parameters."}

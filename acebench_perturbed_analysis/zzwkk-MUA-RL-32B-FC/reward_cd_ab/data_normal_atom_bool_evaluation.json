{"id": "normal_atom_bool_3", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported argument (\"focus_on_cultural_sites\") to the RTA_J function call, causing the function signature not to match and resulting in the failure. Only the departure_point and arrival_point parameters were expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"include_legal_requirements\" parameter in its ERA function call instead of using only the approved \"export_category\" parameter, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_6", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unsupported parameters (\"warranty_check\" and \"include_support_contact\") to the FRI_S function call, resulting in a mismatch with the function's expected argument schema. Only \"customer_id\" and \"purchase_receipt\" should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the parameter \"include_trending_colors\" in the CSA_P function call, which is not part of the expected or supported parameters, resulting in a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\": false parameter when calling TMA_S, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not fully match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to call any tool and instead only discussed service options and asked clarifying questions, rather than directly executing the appropriate encrypted email tool call as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"provide_indoor_options\" in its call to HWA, resulting in a function call that does not match the expected schema, which only allows \"hiking_location\" as an argument."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"include_graphical_analysis\") in the TPIS function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature which only accepts \"simulation_scenario.\""}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported and hallucinated parameters (\"pattern_detection,\" \"include_visualization,\" \"focus_on_physical_training\") to the ETTP function call instead of only passing the required \"training_routine_data\" parameter as specified by the tool description."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an invalid argument (\"include_demographic_info\": true) in its AST function call, which was not supported by the tool schema, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"include_weekend_rules\" to the DTRN function call, resulting in a mismatch with the available tool’s required signature, which only accepts \"area_code\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"consider_temperature\" to the CRBOW function call instead of just providing the required \"city\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the boolean analysis flags (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true, when the expected function call required all of these parameters to be false."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") to the OBD_F function call, which are not supported by the tool's interface, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used an underscore in the area_identifier (\"Amazon_rainforest\") instead of the expected space (\"Amazon rainforest\"), leading to a parameter mismatch and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_43", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"alert_on_storm_warning\" in the BBQEW_S function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool (\"TR_T\") with appropriate parameters, but the industry value was capitalized (\"Technology\") instead of the expected lowercase (\"technology\"), causing a parameter mismatch with the evaluator's strict case-sensitive check."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong function, calling \"baby_health_check_A\" instead of the required \"B_H_C_B\", and failed to include all necessary parameters such as \"baby_behaviors\". This indicates a misunderstanding of tool selection and parameter requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent's function call incorrectly formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as \"18-25\" instead of the expected \"18 to 25,\" causing a mismatch with the required function signature and resulting in failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent called \"phrase_interpret_b\" instead of the lower-cost and expected \"P_I_A\" function to interpret the phrase, failing to use the correct tool as specified in the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call to S_S_A used parameter names and value formats that did not match the expected schema (e.g., incorrect keys like \"brand_recognition_improvement\" instead of \"brand_recognition,\" different customer demographics entries, and inconsistent label phrasing), leading to a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\" as the conflict_element instead of the concise \"AI control\" required by the function signature, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"task_schedule_b\") and used incorrect parameter names and values instead of calling the required \"T_S_A\" function with properly formatted parameters as specified in the ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong step-by-step guide function (vlookup_step_guide_1) instead of the expected V_S_G function, failing to select the correct tool from the available options for the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent altered input values by paraphrasing user-supplied information instead of preserving the original phrasing, causing argument mismatches and failure to exactly match required function call parameter values. This resulted in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent selected the syntax_parsing_b tool instead of the expected S_P_A function, failing to match the required function call despite S_P_A being available and more cost-effective for this input."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" field, causing a mismatch in the function call parameters and failure to match the expected structured input."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported argument (\"include_statistics\":false) in the function call to E_V_B, causing the evaluator to reject the call as it did not exactly match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong function (health_tips_b) instead of the required H_T_A and omitted the mandatory \"age\" parameter, failing to match both the expected tool and parameter format specified for the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the additional context and detailed problem description—such as previous troubleshooting steps and the request for diverse insights—in the arguments for the C_G_B function call, resulting in an insufficient and generic input."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"analyze_social_data_a\" instead of the required \"A_S_D_B\" function, failing to match the expected function name and parameter format despite similar functionality. This indicates it did not select the correct available tool per task requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the M_O_S function call, which is not accepted by the function's schema. Only \"responsive_design\" and \"load_speed\" should have been provided, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent selected the tool \"poetry_analysis_b\" instead of the correct and more cost-effective \"P_A_A\" as specified in the expected answer, failing to match the required function call despite similar tool functionalities."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent generated the function call with an incorrect relation value (\"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\") and an extraneous status detail (\"causing tension\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature required for a correct match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included extra detail (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") for the current_brand_status parameter instead of using the required concise value (\"not well-known\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct tool (M_AG) and provided suitable parameters, but the function call format did not precisely match the expected parameter case-sensitivity (\"AI applications in oncology\" vs. \"AI Applications in Oncology\"), likely causing the evaluator to consider it a mismatch."}

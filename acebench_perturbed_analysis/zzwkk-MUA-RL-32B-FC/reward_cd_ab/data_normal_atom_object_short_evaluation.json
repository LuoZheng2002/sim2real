{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the P_T_E_A function call, which does not match the expected function signature that only accepts \"text\" and \"context\". This caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported or extraneous parameters (\"tilt\", \"safety_checks\", \"adjustment_time\") to the A_S_S function call instead of matching the expected function signature, resulting in a call that did not align with the allowed schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"pop\" (lowercase) for the genre parameter instead of the required \"Pop\" (capitalized), leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluator failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter in the CA_O function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to match the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter in the CTG_T function call, while the tool only accepts \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\"; this caused the function call not to match the available tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"features\" field (an empty list) in the \"simulation_parameters\" of its function call, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"instructorPreference\" field in the MSS_YS function call, which was not present in the expected parameters. This mismatch prevented the evaluator from recognizing the MSS_YS call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with \"light\" correction intensity instead of handling all three recordings with their respective intensities. It failed to make separate function calls for \"medium\" and \"heavy\" recordings as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent generated function calls with correct locations and dates but formatted the Colosseum's year as \"100-08-01\" instead of the expected zero-padded \"0100-08-01\", causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent made only a single function call without specifying patient IDs or date ranges, instead of making separate, parameterized calls for each patient as required. It also chose the less appropriate tool and omitted necessary arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary \"dataOptions\" parameters (\"includeHumidity\" and \"updateFrequency\") in the WF_DF tool call that were not part of the tool's expected schema, resulting in a non-matching function call and evaluation failure."}

{"id": "normal_atom_number_5", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter (\"connectionType\": \"Wi-Fi\") in the SHDI function call; only \"deviceID\" was expected. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"analysisDepth\": 5) in its STE function call, which caused the call to not match the expected schema and led to the evaluator not recognizing it as a valid invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"PlagiarismRiskEvaluator_1\" instead of \"PRE\", despite both tools being available and \"PRE\" being the expected, presumably preferred function. It also failed to pass the draft text as an argument as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"ageGroup\" parameter as an invalid range (20-30) instead of a single integer value (e.g., 20), causing a JSON parsing error and incorrect parameter use for the CPA tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"radius\" parameter in its FNMD function call, which does not match the expected function signature requiring only \"latitude\" and \"longitude.\" This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"riskAppetite\" parameter in the TSIG function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call being recognized by the evaluator. Only the specified parameters should have been passed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect parameter values for \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment\" (7.5 and 300 instead of 5.6 and 900), failing to match the expected function call and thus causing the test failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent called the correct MRC function but set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 10 instead of the expected 1200, failing to accurately capture or infer the extent of the user's message delay issue."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"currency\" in the STE function call, which does not match the expected parameters schema, resulting in a mismatch and failure to trigger the correct tool use."}

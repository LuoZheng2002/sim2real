{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent placed the function call inside nonstandard <tool_call> tags instead of the required <tool_calls> tags or expected response format, causing the evaluator to not recognize any function calls and register a failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1 without specifying required parameters and ignored the lower-cost, otherwise equivalent PFM_F function, which the expected output required with specific parameters for employeeId and feedbackId."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\" as widget IDs instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" field in the \"feedback_form\" object, causing the function call to not match the expected schema for M_F_C, which led to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" parameter (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call that required the review reason to be exactly \"ensure compliance\"."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of the required MAPI_AC function. It failed to configure both the access rules with specific permissions and enable auditing as specified in the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only created the 'Supervisor' role inheriting from 'Admin' and failed to include the previously defined 'Admin' and 'User' roles in the MAPI_UR call, missing the requirement to set up all three roles officially."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly ordered the repaymentOptions array for \"Bank A\" by listing \"lump sum\" before \"installments\", rather than matching the order provided in the user's input or the expected output, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict comparison."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Trattoria near Colosseum\" as the restaurant name and \"Rome\" as the location, rather than interpreting the request and providing a generic \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" with \"near the Colosseum\" as the location per the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"location\" parameter to \"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of just \"Trastevere\" as expected, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called ValidateLeaderInput_checkLeaderType instead of TIM_IR, failing to actually calculate or track the innovation rates as requested. It stopped at validating leaders rather than performing the required analysis on transformational leader teams."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in team names (\"Alpha\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Beta\") when invoking GTS_SM, resulting in function call arguments that did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"endDate\" instead of \"checkoutDate\" in the stayDates parameter and included \"breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"breakfast\" only in preferences, causing the generated function call to not match the precise schema required."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"leadership_analyze_visionary_traits\") instead of the required \"L_C_T_L\" function for comparing two leaders. It failed to select the correct tool specifically designed for leader comparison, as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function arguments for \"agenda\" (\"finalize and sign the contract\") did not match the expected capitalization (\"Finalize and sign the contract\"), resulting in a mismatch and failure to recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a budget range of $100–$200 instead of the user's specified $1000–$2000 range when calling the B_A accommodation booking function, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used the wrong insurance cost value ($115.25 instead of the correct $120.5), failing to select the quoted price from the travel insurance options provided earlier in the conversation.

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required fields: it did not include the \"existing_conditions\" (expected as empty arrays) for each traveler and did not specify the \"duration\" in \"coverage_options,\" leading to a schema mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unchanged impact analysis settings in the TM_D function call instead of only updating the requested communication method, resulting in a call signature that didn't match the evaluator's expected function parameters."}

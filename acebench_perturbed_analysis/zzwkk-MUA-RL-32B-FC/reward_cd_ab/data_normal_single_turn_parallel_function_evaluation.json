{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect datetime formats in the MDO_VC call (included 'T' and 'Z'), and the timeFrame range did not match the requested \"next three days.\" This caused the function call parameters to not match the expected schema and values."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_12", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included an empty \"technologyFeatures\" array in the function call arguments instead of matching the expected \"parameters\" format, causing a mismatch with the required function call schema for RGA_ST."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_18", "analysis": "The agent nested the \"time\" parameter inside the \"customer\" object in the expected output, but in its function calls, \"time\" was a separate top-level argument; this schema mismatch led to no matching function calls being found."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_19", "analysis": "The agent did not match the required parameter field names; it used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" in its function calls, causing the evaluator to fail matching its D_M_S output to the expected format. This reflects a schema compliance error."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_23", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"campaignName\" field in the MC_F function call's \"campaignDetails\" argument, rather than restricting it to just \"campaignId\" as required; this field mismatch led to a failure in function call matching."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent returned the severity of \"swelling\" as 4 instead of the expected 3 in the RBRS_BS function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent only called PCE_PDF to find purpose-driven films, omitting the required CPA_ET call to analyze Blade Runner's existential themes. It also failed to specify \"themes: Existentialism\" for PCE_PDF. Thus, it did not complete both requested subtasks."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"advisoryDetails\" parameter to the CTA_TA function call, which is not part of the expected function signature, causing the call not to match the required format. This resulted in evaluator mismatch and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_42", "analysis": "The agent omitted the event_details field in its function call arguments, producing a schema mismatch with the expected input format for H_M_T, which requires event_details—even if left as an empty array."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_44", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed the pond sample, failing to make function calls for the well, river, spring, and rainwater samples as required. It did not handle all inputs, resulting in an incomplete and insufficient response."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent only processed one vehicle (Car 134) instead of managing communication for all four specified cars. It also omitted required infrastructureResponse details and provided insufficient function calls to fully address the user's multi-step request."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"date\" parameter in the REA_MD (mortgage details) function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema and causing evaluation to fail. All other calls and parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the \"connections\" field for the second circuit by using generic \"resistor\" labels instead of distinct \"resistor1\" and \"resistor2\" identifiers, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent used \"Swimming\" (capitalized) instead of the required lowercase \"swimming\" for the \"sport\" parameter in the O_G_T_A function call, resulting in no matching function call according to the evaluator's strict string matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_65", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"other_elements\" field in the initial_composition parameter for both function calls, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the calls as valid."}

This mismatch in assessmentDate led to no matching function call being found."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_75", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags around its JSON outputs, resulting in invalid JSON that the evaluator could not parse. It should have output only raw JSON objects for the tool calls, without any additional wrapping strings or markup."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent specified an \"intensity\" value of 0.9 for the reverb effect in the A_E_P call instead of the expected value of 1, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the ground truth."}

This caused the tool call to fail."}

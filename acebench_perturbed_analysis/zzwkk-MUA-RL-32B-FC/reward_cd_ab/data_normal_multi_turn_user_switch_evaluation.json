{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unnecessary \"details\" argument with \"cuisineType\" in the tool call. The function signature only requires \"country\" and \"context\"; extra parameters caused the function call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its call to the IP_TRO function, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and thus was not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" argument (keyLength) in the DG_BD function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected input and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter in the ME_EI function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature and failure to execute the function as intended."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of using just \"Paris\" as required, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" as the location instead of just \"Paris,\" causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call that only specifies \"Paris.\" This prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included additional, unsupported parameters (\"translationFeatures\") in the CT_I function call, rather than matching the function's expected signature. Only the required basic parameters should have been provided, causing the function call mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in the CPA_P function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. The absence of this field caused the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extraneous \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the CDM_CS function call, which does not match the tool's expected input schema, leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent provided \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of just \"Tokyo\" as required. This argument mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching. The agent should have used \"Tokyo\" as the destination value."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in its TIO_B function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters and thus failure to produce a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent’s function call format does not precisely match the expected API schema—it used \"arguments\" and nested values instead of a top-level \"parameters\" field, causing evaluator rejection despite correct content and tool name."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"Finance Department\" as the targetGroup, but the expected format was \"finance department\" (all lowercase). This minor casing mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call arguments, which was not part of the expected parameters, resulting in no exact match with the evaluator’s required format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the primaryColor, choosing \"#008000\" instead of the expected \"#00FF00\" for green, failing to follow the user's preference for the specific shade of green they requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"influence\" argument in the C_E_C_M_I function call, which does not match the expected parameters for that tool; only \"period,\" \"composer,\" and \"date_range\" are allowed."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the function call JSON inside XML-like <tool_call> tags, causing parsing failure. The root issue is the agent did not output a valid, standalone JSON object as required for successful function call invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the C_T_E function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"timeOptions\" parameter (\"Morning\") in its DM_VA function call, which does not match the expected function signature and led to evaluator mismatch."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_49_1", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary \"accessibilityOptions\" parameters in the HE_VT function call, which do not match the expected schema, resulting in a failure to recognize the call as valid. The agent should have strictly matched the required parameters."}

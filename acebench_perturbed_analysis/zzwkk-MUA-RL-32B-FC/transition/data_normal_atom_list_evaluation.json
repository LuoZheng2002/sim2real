{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"dayOfWeek\" parameter in the DisneyRides_recommendForKids function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to execute the intended action."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to initiate a function call to check vaccine availability despite having the required location and vaccine types; instead, it responded with an inappropriate error message and did not utilize the available tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The agent failed due to incorrect argument casing; it used \"Millennials\" and \"Fitness\" (capitalized) instead of the required lowercase \"millennials\" and \"fitness\" as expected by the function signature, resulting in a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"targetAudience\" parameter not required or matched by the tool's signature. This caused the function call arguments to deviate from the expected schema, resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"beginner\" as a session option in the function call arguments, whereas only \"45 minutes\" was expected; the \"beginner\" detail should not have been passed in sessionOptions."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the DeviceVerification_verifyDevice tool with the provided IMEI number, instead giving a generic apology and offering to retry, thus not executing the required function as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized \"Winter\" instead of using the expected lowercase \"winter\" in the seasonNames argument, leading to a mismatch with the tool's required parameter format and causing function call recognition failure."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent's function call failed to match expected parameters: it listed only \"crying a lot\" as an additional symptom instead of both \"excessive crying\" and \"decreased appetite,\" and it gave an incomplete baby_behaviors string, missing \"constant crying.\""}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as \"18-25\" (a numeric range) instead of the expected string \"18 to 25\", causing a mismatch with the tool/function input schema and resulting in no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent produced an invalid tool call format by wrapping the JSON output inside non-standard <tool_call> tags, causing a parsing error; additionally, key parameter and content mismatches occurred, such as differing customer demographics and evaluation criteria details."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent used \"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\" as the conflict_element instead of the requested, expected, and more general \"AI control,\" resulting in a function call with unmatched arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_b instead of task_schedule_a, and also used the wrong parameter structure and labels (e.g., \"priority\": \"Urgent\" instead of \"High\", \"duration\" instead of \"estimated_time\", and \"supplies\"/\"staff\" instead of \"material\"/\"human\")."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected parameter values closely enough, particularly in the phrasing of \"investment_preferences\" (\"technology and renewable energy sectors\" vs. \"technology and renewable energy\") and other fields, causing the evaluator to reject the function call due to lack of an exact match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected syntax_parsing_b instead of syntax_parsing_a, despite the sentence being compatible with syntax_parsing_a's requirements (ASCII characters), failing to maintain consistency with previous function use for a similar task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"medium build\" for \"body_type\" instead of the expected \"medium\", resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the function call to not match the specification. The body_type value should exactly match the expected enumeration."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a, which was required for consistency. It also omitted the age parameter, failing to match the structure and selection expected by the test case."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent provided only a brief, generic problem description in its function call instead of the detailed and contextually enriched description expected, missing important observations and explicit requests for diverse perspectives, resulting in a mismatch with the required function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of the required analyze_social_data_b function, failing to use the tool specified for identifying user buying tendencies as per the available tool list and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called poetry_analysis_b with extra author_details instead of calling poetry_analysis_a as required. It failed to select the correct function and provided unnecessary parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" for the relation, added extra detail (\"causing tension\") to the status, and formatted arguments slightly differently, resulting in a mismatch with the evaluator's expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The agent altered the parameter \"theme\" from the expected \"importance of love\" to \"The importance of love,\" adding a definite article. This caused a mismatch with the tool's strict parameter requirements, leading to the function call not matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous detail in the current_brand_status parameter (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") instead of matching the required canonical value (\"not well-known\"), causing a parameter mismatch with the tool schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The failure was caused by a capitalization mismatch in the \"title\" parameter (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs. \"AI applications in oncology\"), leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as matching the expected output."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra \"details\" argument ({\"details\": [{\"cuisineType\": \"Japanese\"}]}) to the function call, deviating from the required parameters (\"country\" and \"context\" only), so the function call signature did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in the data argument: the model omitted the period at the end of \"Confidential Business Strategy.\" in the function call, causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a correct match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature and causing the evaluator to report no matching call found."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" as the museumId parameter value in the MuseumExplorer_getExhibitInfo function call, leading to no match with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" for the location parameter instead of the expected \"Paris\", causing a mismatch with the tool’s accepted parameters and resulting in no function call match. The agent failed to adhere to the tool’s required input format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (translationFeatures and timeOptions) in the function call that were not present in the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failure to call the function as specified."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the location as \"Paris, France\" instead of \"Paris\" in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in the function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the securityOptions at the top-level arguments instead of nesting them within the customer data object, resulting in a payload that does not match the required function schema. This caused the function call to be unrecognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_28_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary \"method\" field (\"standard biodegradable wrapping\") to the packagingOptions, resulting in a function call that does not match the expected parameter structure, which only required the \"material\" key."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The failure was caused by the inclusion of an unsupported parameter, \"analysisDepth\", in the function call. The tool only expects \"demographicFilters\", so the additional argument resulted in a mismatch and function call rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The failure was due to including \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of the expected \"Tokyo\". The function call argument for destination must exactly match the required value, leading to a mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool and arguments, but its output format did not match the expected function call schema—using \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" and inconsistent casing in the \"details\" field—causing the evaluator to fail match detection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of the expected \"#00FF00\" for the primary color, failing to select the correct green shade specified for the brand’s logo design."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call to cultural_tour_experience, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input schema and causing the function call to be invalid."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_49_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the HeritageExplorer_getVirtualTour function as required. Instead, it responded with an unnecessary error apology and questions, missing the direct tool invocation needed to fulfill the user's explicit virtual tour request."}

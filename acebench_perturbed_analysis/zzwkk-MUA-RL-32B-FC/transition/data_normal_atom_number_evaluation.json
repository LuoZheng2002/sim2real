{"id": "normal_atom_number_5", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the SmartHomeDeviceIntegration tool with the provided device ID as required, instead responding with unnecessary troubleshooting dialogue and not making any function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the precise user input \"25\" for ageGroup instead of the required age range anchor \"20,\" failing to align with the expected convention for representing audience age groups (using the lower bound)."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"radius\" parameter when calling FindNearbyMedicineDisposal; only \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" are accepted. This parameter mismatch caused the function call not to match the available tool’s required signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"similarityScore\" parameter to the ContentSimilarityAnalyzer function call, which was not part of the expected or supported parameters, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the EconomicDevelopmentMetrics tool after receiving all required inputs, instead responding with an irrelevant API error and asking the user for data it should have retrieved via the tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_40", "analysis": "The agent failed to issue any function call and instead responded with an irrelevant error message about API latency, missing the requirement to invoke the FacilityAvailabilityChecker tool with the provided hotel code and facilities."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 30 instead of the expected 1200, failing to use the appropriate value for diagnosing the user's message delay issue with MessageReceptionChecker."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_45", "analysis": "The agent failed to initiate the required FloraRecognizer tool call and instead fabricated an error message about service unavailability, resulting in no tool invocation despite having all necessary information to proceed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, which caused a mismatch with the tool's expected arguments and led to the failure."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and arguments but provided the date range for 2023 instead of the intended future year 2024, reflecting a misunderstanding of the user's context (\"next month\") relative to the current year."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_11_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"duration\" parameter in the function call, which caused the evaluator to not recognize the call as matching the expected signature. The function should only include destination, media, and branding fields."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted invalid JSON with an extraneous closing brace and XML-like tags around the tool call, leading to a parsing error. It should have produced a correctly formatted JSON function call without additional markup or syntax."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"feedbackId\": \"most-recent\" parameter in its function call, providing only the employeeId. This led to a mismatch with the expected input format for analyzing the feedback, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent called the function to set up user roles instead of the required function for configuring access control with specific permissions and audit settings, failing to address the user's request for detailed role-based permissions management."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the required identifiers (\"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\"), causing a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" parameter (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of using the precise input \"ensure compliance,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter (\"form_title\": \"Travel Website Feedback\" and \"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\") in the manage_feedback_collection call, causing a schema mismatch with the expected function signature. Only \"feedback_form\" and \"collection_schedule\" were expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"insuranceOptions\" at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it within \"rentalOptions,\" resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent returned the repaymentOptions array for Bank A in the wrong order (lump sum first instead of installments first), resulting in a mismatch with the strictly ordered expected parameters and thus no function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added \"Rome\" to the \"location\" parameter (\"Trastevere, Rome\") instead of using just \"Trastevere\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\") and \"Rome\" as the location, instead of following the user's request for a \"traditional Italian trattoria\" near the Colosseum. The agent should have used the more generic descriptors provided by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\") in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the input validation function instead of the required TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate function, thus failing to calculate or report the innovation rates for the transformational leadership teams as requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the additional parameter \"activityLevel\": \"medium\" in the function call arguments, which was not part of the expected function signature or the user's stated preferences, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to capitalize the first letter of the agenda string (\"finalize\" instead of \"Finalize\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call. This minor formatting inconsistency caused the evaluator to reject the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" as the 'preferences' value, whereas the expected value was \"cozy cottage with breakfast\". This mismatch in parameter value caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\" field in the updatedToolSettings, modifying both \"method\" and \"frequency\" instead of only changing \"method\" as requested; this caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110.0 instead of $120.5) in the travel budget calculation, failing to select the insurance price that matched the user's earlier full-coverage request. This led to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter, specifically the \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\" fields, in its function call, resulting in an incomplete request that did not match the expected tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"existing_conditions\" field (should be an empty list) in each traveler's details and failed to include the \"duration\" field under coverage_options, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the desired_qualities field to \"10+ years industry experience\" instead of preserving the user's original phrasing \"10 years of industry experience,\" causing an argument mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" as a top-level parameter instead of nesting it inside \"user_preferences,\" and used capitalized \"destination_id\" values (\"PARIS,\" \"TOKYO\") rather than the expected \"Paris,\" \"Tokyo,\" resulting in a function call mismatch."}

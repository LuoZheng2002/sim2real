{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call arguments, placing parameters directly at the top level instead of nesting them inside a \"votingContext\" object as required by the CivicDutyAnalyzer_analyzeVotingDuty function specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"time_range\" values for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" argument, rather than simply listing the weekdays as required. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call format, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" parameter wrapper, and it truncated the sample IDs (\"A\", \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\", \"Sample B\"), resulting in a mismatched and incomplete function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"feedback_options\" parameter in its function call, which was not part of the available tool's specification, resulting in no exact match for the expected function signature and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to correctly process the \"availability\" specification, using the vague value \"all platforms\" instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"session_length\" parameter, which is unsupported by the mood_enhancing_playlist_generator function, resulting in a mismatched function call and failure to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"launch of our new product\" to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to reject the output as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the gear information outside the \"hikingDetails\" parameter, instead of nesting it under \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The model outputted the function call arguments under an \"arguments\" key instead of the required \"parameters\" key, causing a schema mismatch and preventing recognition of the correct function call despite the content being otherwise accurate."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent wrapped JSON tool calls in non-standard XML-like <tool_call> tags and used 'arguments' instead of 'parameters' as the key, leading to invalid JSON parsing and schema mismatch, causing the evaluator to fail reading the tool calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted an empty \"settings\" object for the \"summary\" widget in the second dashboard, failing to match the expected function call schema exactly, which requires \"settings\": {} even when no settings are specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, omitting the required separate analysis for indirect employment. It failed to make two distinct function calls—one for direct and one for indirect employment—despite both being explicitly requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"time\" and \"complianceRules\" as top-level parameters instead of nesting \"time\" within the \"customer\" object and omitting \"complianceRules\" entirely, resulting in a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted the required \"user_preferences\" wrapper around the location and routes parameters, resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected function input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in the content_moderation_analysis function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not register the function call as correct."}

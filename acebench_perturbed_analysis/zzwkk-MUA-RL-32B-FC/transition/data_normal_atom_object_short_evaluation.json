{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameter schema and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_5", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required tool function to configure the wireless charging session, instead providing an apologetic message and request for user confirmation without making any function call, despite having all necessary information."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent unnecessarily added a \"safety_checks\" field to the locking_mechanism argument, which is not expected or supported by the function schema, resulting in a mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent failed to issue the required tool call to retrieve historical satellite imagery, instead providing an irrelevant apology and asking for retry confirmation. It did not take any action or use the <tool_call> syntax as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call, causing the output to not match the expected schema and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent over-specified the \"protocol\" parameter by including unnecessary \"details\" fields not defined in the function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failure to produce a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent outputted the genre value as \"pop\" (lowercase), whereas the expected function call required \"Pop\" (capitalized). This discrepancy in case sensitivity led to the evaluator failing to match the function call, despite all other parameters being correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter to the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected input schema for CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline, leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, empty \"features\" field in the \"simulation_parameters\" object, causing its function call to differ structurally from the exact expected format, resulting in a mismatch and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with the \"light\" correction intensity, omitting the \"medium\" and \"heavy\" recordings and their associated function calls, thus failing to handle all user-provided inputs as explicitly requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent provided correct tool calls for the requested locations and dates, but formatted the year 100 AD as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required four-digit format \"0100-08-01\", causing the evaluator to fail matching the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption instead of combining both operations into a single call with both parameter sets, as required by the tool's specification."}

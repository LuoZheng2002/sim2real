{"id": "normal_atom_enum_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the appropriate tool after receiving all necessary information from the user, instead responding with a meta-comment about API/server issues, thus not attempting the expected function call or analysis."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the values for \"investmentSize\" and \"marketDynamics\" in the function call; the expected values are lowercase (\"moderate\", \"dynamic\"), so the evaluator did not recognize the function call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the \"outputDetail\" parameter as \"Detailed\" instead of the expected \"Summary,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the evaluator's required signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_26", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required function to generate the coverage report and instead responded with an irrelevant error message about network issues, demonstrating a lack of tool use despite the user's clarified request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_30", "analysis": "The agent used an invalid value (\"Comprehensive\") for the \"detailLevel\" parameter instead of the required \"Detailed\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"weatherDetail\" argument not supported by the FlightStatus_checkFlightAndWeather function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to invoke the function as specified by the API."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter in the function call, failing to specify that only games with good ratings should be recommended as requested by the user."}

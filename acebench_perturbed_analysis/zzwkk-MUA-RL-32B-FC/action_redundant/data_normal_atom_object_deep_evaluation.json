{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_1", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON due to an extra closing brace and enclosing the tool call in non-standard <tool_call> tags. This formatting error prevented parsing, despite an otherwise correct function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent failed to wrap the input parameters in the required \"votingContext\" object, instead passing them at the top level, resulting in a function call argument structure mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"time_range\" values (09:00-17:00) for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" field. The expected format was to list only the days (Monday–Friday) without specifying time ranges."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the parameters for the heritage_degradationAnalysis function call, using \"monumentID\" and \"materialSamples\" directly instead of nesting them within a \"monumentDetails\" object as required by the function schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"feedback_options\" parameter to the publicSpeaking_coach function call, which is not part of the expected schema, rather than only updating the session_details as requested. This resulted in a schema mismatch and no valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to accurately specify the required \"availability\" field for the fireworks safety app, returning a generic \"all platforms\" instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" as requested, leading to a mismatch in the function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter (\"session_length\") in the function call to mood_enhancing_playlist_generator, which caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and led to the evaluator not recognizing the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"frequency\" field (\"frequency\": \"weekly\") in the \"retraining_schedule\" parameter, making the function call signature not match the expected parameters for ai_security_model_hardening, resulting in a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" (as specified by the user) to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent misplaced the \"gear\" parameter outside of \"hikingDetails\" in its function call, resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected function signature. This structural error prevented recognition of the function call by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the CommunityAidCenter_manageCollectionPoints function and instead requested extra information (maximum capacity) not required by the function specification, resulting in no function/tool call being made."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent outputted tool calls wrapped in invalid XML-like tags (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\"), causing a JSON parsing failure. The tool calls must be provided as valid JSON objects or arrays directly, without extra markup or formatting artifacts."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard configuration, resulting in a mismatched function call structure compared to the expected output. This structural discrepancy caused the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and omitted the required analysis for indirect employment, failing to issue separate function calls for both direct and indirect employment types as specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"complianceRules\" argument to the GeoCompliance_verifyCustomerLocation function call, which is not part of the expected input schema, causing the evaluator to reject the calls as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_44", "analysis": "The agent only made a single function call evaluating the first function’s points, instead of issuing separate calls for all five functions as required by the multi-part user request. It failed to process the entire list of evaluations."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. The tool only supports \"content\" and \"context\" parameters."}

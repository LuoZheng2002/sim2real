{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to use the function specifically designed to address persistent vein visibility and associated symptoms, as indicated in the instructions and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the temperature range as \"18-25\" instead of \"18 to 25\" as required by the tool's schema, leading to a mismatch and failure to recognize the function call. The temperature range string was not normalized to the accepted format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent output the function call wrapped in an invalid <tool_call> XML tag, causing a parsing error. Additionally, field names and values did not align with the expected schema (e.g., \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" and incorrect demographic details)."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent provided an overly detailed \"conflict_element\" (\"struggle for control between human authorities and autonomous AI systems\") instead of using the concise expected keyword \"AI control,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the task_schedule_b function instead of the required task_schedule_a, and also mismapped field names and values (e.g., \"priority\" as \"Urgent\" instead of \"High\", \"duration\" instead of \"estimated_time\", and incorrect resources keys)."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called finance_advisor_b instead of finance_advisor_a as required. It failed to select the correct tool despite both being available, causing a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected syntax_parsing_b instead of syntax_parsing_a, failing to match the expected tool despite the sentence containing only ASCII characters, which syntax_parsing_a supports. It did not adhere to the tool selection demonstrated in the conversation history."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"medium build\" instead of the required value \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" field, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call format for style_recommendation_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"health_tips_b\" instead of the expected \"health_tips_a\" and omitted the required \"age\" parameter, failing to match the specified tool and required arguments for the follow-up dietary advice request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to synthesize or elicit multiple perspectives or user insights about the problem before calling clarity_guide_b, simply restating the initial issue rather than expanding or diversifying it as the tool is intended for."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, which is the tool specifically designed for identifying user buying tendencies as required by the question. Thus, the function selection did not match the task intent."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the poetry_analysis_b tool instead of the required poetry_analysis_a, failing to match the function specified in the expected answer despite both being available with similar purposes."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided input to the \"motivate_social_b\" function, which is intended for general relationship building, rather than using the more appropriate \"resolve_social_conflict_b\" function specifically designed to address and resolve interpersonal conflicts like the one described."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous descriptive information (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") for the current_brand_status parameter instead of standardizing the value to the expected canonical form (\"not well-known\"), leading to the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The function call parameters differ in case sensitivity for the \"title\" field (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs. \"AI applications in oncology\"), causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as matching the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_49", "analysis": "The agent misspelled the key in the function arguments: it used \"interestes\" instead of \"interests\", causing the function call not to match the expected schema and resulting in evaluation failure."}

{"id": "normal_atom_number_5", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"connectionType\" parameter (\"Wi-Fi\") in the function call, which is not supported by the SmartHomeDeviceIntegration tool's specification, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"analysisDepth\": 5) in the function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, which does not match the tool's specification, resulting in a mismatch and failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"ageGroup\" argument incorrectly as \"20-30\" (a range without quotes) instead of a valid value (e.g., a single number or a properly quoted string). This caused a JSON parsing error, preventing correct function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"riskAppetite\" parameter in the TechStockInsightGenerator call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only \"industry,\" \"daysToAnalyze,\" and \"predictionDays\" were allowed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent's function call to EconomicDevelopmentMetrics omitted the requested service sector growth and foreign investment parameters, failing to use all necessary inputs for a complete and correct function call as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_35", "analysis": "The agent constructed the correct function call but output it using an invalid XML-like <tool_call> wrapper format instead of the expected JSON structure, causing the evaluator to miss the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the PeerCompanyValuation function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature which only requires \"companyID\" and \"valuationMetric\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 30 instead of the expected 1200, failing to properly interpret or request the significant message delay reported by the user. This led to a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, resulting in no exact match with the expected function signature and causing the failure. The function only accepts \"companySymbol\" and \"analysisPeriod\"."}

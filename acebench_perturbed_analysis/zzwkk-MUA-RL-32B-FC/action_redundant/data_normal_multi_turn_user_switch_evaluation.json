{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"timePeriod\", \"details\") in the function call, instead of just \"country\" and \"context\" as required by the tool schema, resulting in a call that did not match the expected input signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as correct."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"France\" in the location parameter instead of just \"Paris\" as expected by the function's strict parameter requirements, resulting in a parameter mismatch and the function call not being recognized by the evaluator."}

The mismatch in string casing caused the evaluator not to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in the casing of the \"targetGroup\" parameter (\"Finance Department\" vs \"finance department\"), leading to the function call not matching the expected output exactly.

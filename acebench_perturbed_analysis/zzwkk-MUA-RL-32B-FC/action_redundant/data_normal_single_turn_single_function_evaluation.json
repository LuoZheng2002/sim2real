{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The model’s function call used capitalized names (\"User\", \"Sister\"), while the reference expected lowercase (\"user\", \"sister\"), and their relationships were both set as \"Grandchild\" instead of distinguishing roles. This mismatch led to the evaluator not finding a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The root cause is that the model included time values with time components (\"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z\") instead of plain date strings (\"2023-05-01\"), resulting in no exact match for the function call despite otherwise correct arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect dataSources format: it supplied \"sourceId\": \"techdataapi\" instead of the required sourceId \"1\" as per the tool's schema, leading to a mismatch and no valid function call match."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to make the required function call; it only described its intent and asked clarifying questions without actually invoking the ElderlyTransportScheduler_scheduleRide tool as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_17", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON for the tool call by including an extra closing brace, leading to a parsing error. The root cause is incorrect formatting of the function call output, not a reasoning or parameter selection issue."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent formatted the ISO datetime strings with a \"Z\" suffix indicating UTC (e.g., \"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\"), while the expected function call required datetimes without the \"Z\" (e.g., \"2024-01-15T00:00:00\"), causing a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption, instead of combining both tasks into a single call to WebSecurity_EncryptionManager as expected by the interface specification."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent generated incorrect campaign details: the campaign title differs, the date is in 2024 instead of 2023, and the targeted age range is capped at 30 instead of 35—all causing mismatched function parameters versus the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent failed to extract the provided features and invoke the SpeciesClassifier_identifyFeatures tool; instead, it asked the user for more details, ignoring both the supplied observations and the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required historical flag and unique source_id fields for each traffic source in the traffic_data parameter, resulting in a structure mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The agent used the restaurant_id as \"luigis_italian_restaurant\" (a lowercase, underscored form) instead of the expected \"Luigi's Italian Restaurant\" (proper cased with punctuation), causing a mismatch with the tool's expected parameter format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the key \"neural_network_parameters\" (with layer and activation details) in the function call arguments, which doesn't match the function's expected parameter schema. This caused a schema mismatch and the function call was not recognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent provided a function call with a generic placeholder (\"Provided base64 encoded string\") instead of using the user-supplied base64 image string, failing to correctly populate the required imageData parameter as specified in the task."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Free Play\" activity in the routineDetails, failing to fully capture the user's request for breakfast, exercise, and some free play before school."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_52", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the JSON function/tool call within custom XML-like <tool_call> tags, resulting in invalid output format and a JSON parsing error due to the extraneous trailing characters. The tool call should have been output as pure JSON without additional markup."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"consumptionTime\" and \"temperature\" at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting them inside \"teaDetails\" as required by the BeverageHealthAnalyzer_getTeaBenefits function schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_59", "analysis": "The agent wrapped the tool call JSON inside an extra outer <tool_call>...</tool_call> tag, and also produced a JSON object rather than a JSON array as required, causing parsing errors and a mismatch with the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary XML-like tags (<tool_call>...</tool_call>) around its JSON output, resulting in invalid JSON with trailing characters, which prevented parsing and proper function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_69", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"speciesDetails\" argument (as an empty list) in the function call, which does not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject the call. The tool expects only \"desert\" and \"timePeriod\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested \"vibration_patterns\" inside \"app_details\" instead of providing it as a top-level parameter alongside \"app_details\" in the HapticFeedbackIntegration function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent set the \"end\" timestamp in the \"timeWindow\" parameter to \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the expected \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", causing an exact parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped its tool call JSON within XML-like <tool_call> tags and included an extra closing brace, resulting in malformed JSON that the evaluator could not parse. The function call should have been valid, standalone JSON."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_84", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"fontWeight\" field (\"Regular\") in the \"typographyPreferences\" that was not expected. This mismatch in function call arguments led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"process_info\" field in the \"details\" argument, resulting in a function call structure that did not match the expected schema. This caused the function call to be unrecognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"siteId\" as \"GreatWall_Beijing\" instead of \"Great Wall Beijing\" as required by the function schema, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}

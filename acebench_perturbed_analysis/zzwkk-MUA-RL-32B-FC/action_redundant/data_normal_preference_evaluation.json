{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the resetPassword tool despite being provided with all necessary information in the user request, instead prompting for input that was already available, resulting in no tool call being made."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to recognize that sufficient information was already provided to update the profile and did not call the updateUserProfile tool as required, instead prompting the user unnecessarily for more details."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to recognize that the user's request required a direct calculation of shipping cost using the provided dimensions, shipping method, and membership status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the \"UserPreferredCategories\" parameter as \"Sports\" instead of the expected \"Sports Goods,\" leading to a mismatch with the required function call signature and failure to match the expected result structure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the updateUserProfile function as required. Instead, it only retrieved the user profile summary, neglecting to perform the requested update to the preferred notification method or verify/upsert the email and home location."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent only called loginUser with email and an incorrect password, omitting the required userPreferredLoginTime and loginFrequency parameters. It failed to capture and use user preferences as specified in the user's request and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent changed the user's email address to an incorrect value not provided or implied by the user, and inaccurately paraphrased \"a town near Austin\" as \"Near Austin, TX,\" failing to preserve user intent and requested data fidelity."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books, Wellness\" instead of only \"Wellness\" as expected, resulting in a function call signature mismatch and failure to match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent arbitrarily used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of retrieving or correctly applying the user's actual membership status (\"Bronze\"), leading to a parameter mismatch in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_19", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous detail (\"Credit Card ending in 1234\") for the PaymentMethodName parameter, which did not match the expected value (\"Credit Card\"), leading to a function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the updateUserProfile tool call with the provided details; instead, it unnecessarily asked the user for information that was already available or implied, resulting in no tool usage and an unfulfilled update request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Chicken Fajitas\" as the OrderName instead of the more generic \"Mexican meal\" specified by the user, leading to a parameter mismatch and the evaluator failing to recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the necessary \"updateUserProfile\" tool call and instead responded conversationally, asking for user input, rather than executing the requested profile update with the provided data."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a case mismatch in the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Dinner Order\" vs. expected \"dinner order\"), causing the evaluator's strict matching to not recognize the function call as valid. All other details were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the correct restaurant name; it used \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of the required \"small burger place by the elm park,\" leading to a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in the UserDietaryPreference field instead of only \"Gluten-Free\" as expected, leading to a mismatch in function call parameters and causing the evaluator not to recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The failure was due to a mismatch in the parameter name \"OrderName\" casing—the model used \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected lowercase \"dinner order.\" This prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and unnecessarily included the UserDietaryPreference parameter, which should be null in the function call for addMenuItem."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the expected \"sushi order.\" This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as it did not match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required UserDietaryPreferences and UserMembershipStatus fields in the submitReview call, omitting key user details explicitly requested in the original question, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_41", "analysis": "The agent's function call to sendOrderUpdate omitted the required OrderStatus parameter (\"Out for Delivery\"); it only included UserName and HomeLocation, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to convey the necessary status update information."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly substituted \"Kimchi Palace\" for the restaurant name instead of using \"My favorite Korean joint,\" and misinterpreted the dietary preference as \"Korean\" instead of the user's dietary style \"Spicy,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent called processRefund with incorrect parameters: it used the wrong refund amount (15.99 instead of 350) and selected \"Original Method\" rather than the expected \"Store Credit\" for UserRefundPreference, indicating a failure to extract and map the correct details from the user's context."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align the menu item with the user's actual dietary preference as described in the item's name and implied in the request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the updateUserProfile function as required, instead responding conversationally and deferring action until the user provides new input, despite the instruction to update the home location to \"San Diego, CA\". No tool call was issued."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The model incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") into a single string for the UserDietaryPreference parameter instead of providing only the expected value (\"Vegetarian\"), leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}

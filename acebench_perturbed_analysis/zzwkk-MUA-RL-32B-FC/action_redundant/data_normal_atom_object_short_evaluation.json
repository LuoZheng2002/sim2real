{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the function call to poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, which does not match the tool’s defined signature, leading to failure in matching the expected call. Only the \"culture\" field is allowed in context."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"adjustment_time\" parameter (\"gradual\") in its adjust_seat_safety function call, which is not part of the function's defined signature, causing a mismatch and failure to execute the intended action."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary protocol \"details\" fields in the function arguments, which are not accepted by the DeviceConnection_authenticateBluetooth function schema. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and led to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used a lowercased value \"pop\" instead of the expected capitalized \"Pop\" for the genre parameter, resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to match the evaluator's criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter to the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature that only accepts \"caseId\" and \"timeRange.\""}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"equipment\" field in the function call arguments, which is not expected by the tool schema, causing a mismatch and failure to recognize the function call despite otherwise correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with \"light\" intensity and ignored the other two files and correction intensities requested by the user. It also added an unsupported \"feedbackMode\" parameter to the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_40", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed the first ceramic sample, failing to process and identify the ceramic type for the second sample as required by the user's request. Only one function call was made instead of two."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption instead of combining both into a single call as required by the tool's expected input schema. This resulted in a mismatch in the number of function calls."}

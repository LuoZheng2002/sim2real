{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_3_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the user's specified travel dates (\"2023-10-10\" to \"2023-10-20\") in the user_preferences parameter when calling the virtual_travel_guide function, resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_10_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the tool call by embedding all parameters into a single \"name\" string and omitted the required \"arguments\" (or \"parameters\") field, failing to pass structured arguments as expected by the function-calling schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous characters (a closing curly brace and XML-like tags) around the tool call, resulting in invalid JSON output that failed to parse. It should have output only the pure JSON object for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected (\"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\"), causing the evaluator to not match the function call and resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"feedback_type\" in the manage_feedback_collection function call, which was not expected or required by the tool schema; this caused a mismatch and resulted in a failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent added the unnecessary word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" argument, resulting in \"to ensure compliance\" instead of the expected \"ensure compliance,\" causing a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"feedbackId\": \"most-recent\" parameter in the function call, only providing \"employeeId\". This omission caused the call not to match the expected function signature, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the repayment options for \"Bank A\" in a different order (\"lump sum\" before \"installments\") than the expected output, leading to a mismatch in function call argument structure and causing evaluator failure due to strict parameter order checking."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"auditEnabled\": true parameter in its call to securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, failing to fully specify the expected configuration for audit trails alongside the access rules."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"endDate\" instead of the expected \"checkOutDate\" in the stayDuration parameter for the HotelBookingService_reserveHotel function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed insuranceOptions outside of the rentalOptions object in the function arguments, resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected CarRentalService_reserveVehicle function call parameter structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent used inquire_menu instead of book_dining, failing to make the required dining reservation. It did not proceed with booking a table as requested, instead only attempting to retrieve menu information, thus failing to fulfill the explicit booking task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Trastevere, Rome\" as the location instead of just \"Trastevere\", causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters that required only \"Trastevere\" for location. All other aspects matched, but the slight location mismatch led to failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent only validated the leader types instead of invoking the required function to calculate innovation rates. It failed to call TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate with the provided data, thus not fulfilling the core user request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\") when generating the report, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" instead of \"breakfast\" in the preferences parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the failure to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, failing to use the tool specifically designed to compare two leaders as instructed by the task and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The model's function call did not match the expected format due to casing differences in the \"agenda\" parameter (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs. \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), leading the evaluator to not recognize the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified accommodation budget of $1000–$2000 and instead used an incorrect lower budget of $100–$200 in the book_accommodation function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent modified both the communicationModule and the impactAnalysisModule settings, but the user only requested changing the communication method to Email while keeping other settings unchanged; thus, the function call over-specified updates."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110) instead of selecting the quote that covered all requested coverages ($120.5). It failed to match the user's requirements to the correct insurance option when calculating the travel budget."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields—existing_conditions (should be an empty array for each traveler) and the \"duration\" field under coverage_options—in the function call. This mismatch caused the call not to match the expected parameters, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_1", "analysis": "The agent only checked availability for the requested room but failed to proceed with the hotel booking by not invoking hotelBookingService_bookHotel as explicitly requested by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent reformulated the desired quality \"10 years of industry experience\" as \"10+ years industry experience\" instead of copying it verbatim, resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it within \"user_preferences\" as required by the expected function signature, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}

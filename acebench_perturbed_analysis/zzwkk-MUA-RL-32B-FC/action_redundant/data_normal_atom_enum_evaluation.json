{"id": "normal_atom_enum_9", "analysis": "The root cause is case sensitivity: the model used capitalized values (\"Moderate\", \"Dynamic\") for investmentSize and marketDynamics instead of the expected lowercase (\"moderate\", \"dynamic\"), leading to a mismatch with the evaluator's function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent used a parameter (\"outputDetail\": \"Detailed\") that does not match the available tool's expected parameters, which either caused a schema mismatch or an unrecognized function signature, leading to no matching function call being registered."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_30", "analysis": "The agent used an unsupported argument value (\"Comprehensive\") for the \"detailLevel\" parameter instead of the expected (\"Detailed\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the tool's accepted input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_37", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"weatherDetail\": \"Detailed\" in the function call, which is not part of the expected parameters for FlightStatus_checkFlightAndWeather, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter in the function call, failing to incorporate the user's request for games with good ratings into the tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_46", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the \"rating\": \"high\" parameter in its function call, resulting in an incomplete request that did not filter for highly rated games as explicitly asked in the user's query."}

{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the \"dayOfWeek\" parameter required by the DisneyRides_recommendForKids function, resulting in its function call not matching the expected tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool and parameters, but failed to match the expected answer due to a capitalization mismatch (\"Millennials\", \"Fitness\" vs. \"millennials\", \"fitness\"). The function call arguments must use the exact expected casing."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the phrase \"focus on\" in one of the business goals, providing \"promote artisan coffee and desserts\" instead of \"focus on artisan coffee and desserts,\" causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_15", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"beginner\" option in the sessionOptions argument. Only \"45 minutes\" was expected; \"beginner\" is already implicit in the tool's description and not a valid session option parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required OnlineFitnessClass_register tool and instead requested unnecessary information from the user, missing the function-calling protocol entirely and not initiating the registration process as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\") in its function call to GlobalAirQuality_queryCities, resulting in a call signature mismatch with the expected input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_45", "analysis": "The model capitalized \"Technology\" in the sectorList parameter instead of using the required lowercase \"technology,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to evaluator failure."}

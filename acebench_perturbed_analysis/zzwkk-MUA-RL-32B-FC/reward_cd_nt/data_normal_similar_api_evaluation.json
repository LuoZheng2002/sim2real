{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the appropriate function for persistent vein visibility with concerning symptoms as described in the user's query."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent's function call used the temperature range \"18-25\" instead of the required format \"18 to 25\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and causing the evaluator to report no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments did not exactly match the expected parameter values (e.g., details in competitor analysis, demographics, evaluation criteria wording), leading to no match. Additionally, slight differences in argument structure or content blocked successful matching, despite calling the correct function."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary detail in the \"conflict_element\" argument (\"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\") instead of matching the expected succinct value (\"AI control\"), leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_b instead of task_schedule_a as required, and used mismatched parameter names and values (e.g., \"priority\": \"Urgent\" instead of \"High\", \"duration\" instead of \"estimated_time\"), failing to match the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary detail and paraphrased user inputs in its function call parameters instead of matching the expected phrasing, leading to a mismatch with the strict parameter values required by the evaluator for finance_advisor_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the syntax_parsing_b tool with custom grammar rules instead of using syntax_parsing_a, which was expected and appropriate for checking a French sentence for grammatical correctness."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly output \"medium build\" instead of \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" parameter, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call signature and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent improperly formatted the tool call by omitting the required 'arguments' (or 'parameters') field and instead included a stringified function signature, causing the call to be unprocessable by the tool API."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to clarity_guide_b lacked sufficient detail in the problem_description parameter; it simply repeated the brief original issue instead of providing the expanded, context-rich description expected from the conversation history and prior clarification steps."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, failing to use the required function to analyze user buying tendencies as specified in the task and tools list. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool (\"motivate_social_b\") but introduced deviations in the function arguments: it used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" for the relation, expanded the \"status\" field with extra information not in the user statement, and formatted arguments slightly differently than expected, leading to mismatch with the evaluator's strict signature requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unnecessary details (\"fairly new and currently not well-known\") in the current_brand_status parameter instead of exactly matching the required value \"not well-known,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"focus_area\" parameter in its call to med_aiArticleGen, resulting in a mismatched function call that did not adhere to the tool's expected input structure."}

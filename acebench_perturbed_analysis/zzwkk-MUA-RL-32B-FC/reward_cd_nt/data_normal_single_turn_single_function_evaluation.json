{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and arguments but failed to disambiguate between two available functions with the same name; it should have selected \"InheritanceLegalAdvisor_queryInheritanceLaws\" (cost $0.01) per the expected answer instead of outputting an ambiguous or generic call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call structure, but used the ISO 8601 datetime format instead of the expected YYYY-MM-DD date format for the \"time_frame\" parameters, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's required input."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call format by providing \"sourceId\": \"techdataapi\" instead of the required \"sourceId\": \"1\", causing a mismatch with the function signature and preventing successful function execution."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent called WeatherForecast_getDetailedForecast with additional unsupported \"dataOptions\" parameters not required by the function schema, causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in no valid function call being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included a \"Z\" (Zulu/UTC time indicator) in the timeRange values for start and end, while the expected function call did not include \"Z\". This minor formatting mismatch prevented exact function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extraneous XML-like tags (<tool_call>...</tool_call>) around the JSON function call, resulting in invalid JSON output that could not be parsed by the evaluator. The function call content itself was otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent specified a start and end year of 2024 instead of the expected 2023 for the campaign duration and set the age range maximum to 30 rather than the expected 35, causing the function call parameters to mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected input signature and causing the call not to be recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required tool and instead asked the user for more information, despite having sufficient details to make the function call with the provided features. It did not execute the expected SpeciesClassifier_identifyFeatures tool call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields (\"historical\", \"source_id\") within \"traffic_data\" and did not structure \"traffic_sources\" as specified. The arguments do not match the expected schema, leading to a failure in identifying a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent failed to specify which version of the \"ContentAuthenticity_verifyImageOriginality\" function to call, resulting in an ambiguous function call name that does not match any available tool; it should have used the exact tool name from the list."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the \"Free Play\" activity requested in the user's instructions, resulting in an incomplete routine that does not match the user's requirements or the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_52", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the tool call JSON in XML-like <tool_call> tags, producing invalid JSON output that could not be parsed, instead of returning a pure JSON tool invocation as required."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name but did not match the required function call parameter structure exactly (capitalization in \"teaName\": \"Green Tea\" instead of \"green tea\"). This strict mismatch caused the failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function name (\"BookRecommendationEngine_fetchRecommendations\") but included an extra \"readingLevel\" field in the \"userProfile\" argument, which does not match the expected parameters, leading to the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped its JSON function call output with XML-like <tool_call> tags and included an extra closing brace, producing invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the tool-calling evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the vibration_patterns parameter inside app_details instead of at the top level of the function arguments, resulting in a mismatched function call structure that did not align with the expected API schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent specified \"23:59:59\" as the end time instead of the required \"23:59:00\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"timeFrame\" argument in its call to ConversationManager_linkMessages, resulting in a function signature mismatch and failure to match the expected function call parameters precisely."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"process_info\" field in the function arguments, causing a mismatch with the required schema. This led to the function call not matching the available tool's expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used a siteId value (\"GreatWall_Beijing\") in snake_case instead of the expected string (\"Great Wall Beijing\"), causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to directly submit the required review via the DecisionAudit_submitReview function, instead retrieving decision details unnecessarily and omitting the actual submit function call with the provided comments and approval status."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and region but provided the date range for 2023 instead of 2024, failing to infer that \"next month\" from the 2024 context should reference March 2024, not a past year."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent invoked the wrong function—PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1 instead of the lower-cost, correct PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback—and it also omitted the required parameters employeeId and feedbackId, resulting in a mismatched and parameterless call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function to set up user roles instead of the required function to configure access control with specific role-based permissions and auditing, thus failing to apply the necessary permissions and audit settings as requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\" as the reviewReason, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", causing the function call not to match the expected schema as required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent used <tool_call> tags in its response instead of the required <tool_calls> tags for function call formatting, resulting in the evaluator not detecting any valid tool invocation despite correct function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Rome\" in the location parameter (\"Trastevere, Rome\") instead of using just \"Trastevere\" as expected, causing a mismatch with the evaluator which prevented recognition of the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent used an inferred or fabricated restaurant name (\"Trattoria near Colosseum\") instead of the user-specified preference (\"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" near the Colosseum), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected restaurant name parameter."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter (\"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\") in the manage_feedback_collection function call, resulting in a call signature that did not match any available tool, leading to the evaluator rejecting the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent only validated the leader types and stopped, failing to call TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate to actually calculate the innovation rates for the transformational teams as required by the prompt."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\") in the function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function financeManager_manageDebt but listed repaymentOptions for \"Bank A\" out of the expected order (\"lump sum\" before \"installments\"); the evaluator likely requires strict key/value order matching, causing the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, thus failing to perform the requested comparative analysis between the two leaders."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences value instead of matching the expected \"breakfast\". This minor phrasing difference caused a mismatch with the strict evaluator and led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent called schedule_meeting instead of schedule_meeting_1, even though both are available tools. The evaluator expects a call to the correct, uniquely named function (schedule_meeting_1), but the agent selected the generic schedule_meeting, resulting in no match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent attempted to modify both the communication and impact analysis modules, instead of only updating the communication method from Slack to Email as requested. It included unnecessary fields, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a budget of $100–$200 for booking accommodation instead of the user's stated budget of $1000–$2000, resulting in the wrong function call parameters and a mismatch with the expected behavior."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but supplied an incorrect insurance_cost value ($115.25 instead of the correct $120.5 per person as provided in previous tool outputs), indicating a failure to correctly extract and sum the appropriate insurance option cost."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required fields \"existing_conditions\" in \"traveler_details\" and \"duration\" in \"coverage_options,\" resulting in a call that did not match the expected schema. This prevented successful execution despite calling the correct function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"10+ years industry experience\" instead of matching the expected \"10 years of industry experience\" for desired_qualities, causing a mismatch in normalized argument values and resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed travel_dates inside the top-level function arguments instead of nesting it within user_preferences, resulting in a mismatched parameter structure that prevented the function call from matching the expected schema."}

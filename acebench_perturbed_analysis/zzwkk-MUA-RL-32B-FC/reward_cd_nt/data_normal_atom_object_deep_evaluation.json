{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unnecessary \"time_range\" fields to the \"time_restrictions\" for each day, rather than just specifying the days as in the expected parameters. This caused its function call to not match the required API signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleIDs (\"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\") and did not wrap parameters under the required \"monumentDetails\" key, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported \"feedback_options\" in its function call arguments, deviating from the expected schema which requires only \"session_details\" for publicSpeaking_coach, resulting in a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"all platforms\" instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" for the fireworks safety app availability, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This causes the call not to match the required schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra irrelevant parameter \"session_length\" in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and thus failing to match the valid function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent changed the meeting topic wording from \"Launch of our new product\" (expected) to \"New Product Launch Discussion\" (actual), resulting in the function call not matching the expected specification and thus failing the evaluator's exact match criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent inserted the \"gear\" object as a top-level argument to the function instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails.gear\" as required by the function signature, resulting in a schema mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent specified the correct tool name in its function call, but formatted the arguments under \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters\" key. This schema mismatch prevented the evaluator from matching the function call, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"capacity\" parameter not supported by the schema and failed to specify which variant of the CommunityAidCenter_manageCollectionPoints tool to use, causing a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent enclosed its JSON tool calls within extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags, causing invalid output that could not be parsed. The root problem is incorrect formatting of tool calls, not adhering to the required raw JSON structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required empty \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard. This led to a function call argument mismatch with the expected schema, causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only generated a function call for direct employment, failing to make a separate call for indirect employment as the question required an analysis for both types."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra empty \"complianceRules\" argument in the function calls, causing them not to match the expected signature and resulting in evaluation failure. The calls should have omitted the \"complianceRules\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" parameter to the content_moderation_analysis function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}

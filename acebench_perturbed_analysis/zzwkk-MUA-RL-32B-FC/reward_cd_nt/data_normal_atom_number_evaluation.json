{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" in the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in no valid match being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON by using an unquoted and improperly formatted range (20-30) for the \"ageGroup\" field instead of a single integer or proper formatting. This caused a parsing error and prevented successful tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"riskAppetite\" parameter in the TechStockInsightGenerator function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and preventing successful function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent called EconomicDevelopmentMetrics with only the industrialOutput parameter, omitting required parameters serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment, leading to an incomplete function call and failure to match the expected input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent used the MessageReceptionChecker tool with an unrealistically low receptionDelay value (10 instead of the expected 1200), failing to accurately represent the user's reported delay and thus not matching the expected function call parameters."}

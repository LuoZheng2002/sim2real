{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected signature for poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, which requires only \"text\" and \"context\" (with \"culture\"), leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"tilt\", \"adjustment_time\", and \"safety_checks\") in its adjust_seat_safety function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported extra parameter (\"printTime\") in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected schema and tools. Only the specified parameters should have been included for a correct match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent called MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks instead of the correctly enumerated tool MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks_1, failing to match the available tool's exact name as required by the function-calling interface."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call instead of accepting it."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"eventTypes\" parameter not supported by the expected function signature, resulting in a non-matching function call. Additionally, it did not choose between the two available CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline variants based on descriptor or cost."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary instructorPreference field in the MindfulSessionScheduler_scheduleYogaStream function call arguments, which was not part of the expected parameters, causing a mismatch with the accepted function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file (\"recording_light.mp3\") instead of all three provided. It failed to make separate function calls for each recording with the specified correction intensities."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent provided correctly structured function calls, but for the Colosseum query, it used the year format \"100-08-01\" instead of the expected \"0100-08-01\", leading to a mismatch with the evaluator's strict date formatting requirement."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent made only a single, incorrect function call (hospital_record_fetch_1) without specifying patient IDs or date ranges, instead of making four separate hospital_record_fetch calls (one per patient with correct parameters) as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"dataOptions\" parameter not expected by the function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as a mismatch despite correct core parameters. The agent failed to conform exactly to the expected argument schema."}

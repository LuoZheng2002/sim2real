{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, leading to a mismatch with the expected tool invocation format. This resulted in the function call not being recognized or matched by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"analysisPeriod\" parameter in its SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions function call, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected input signature and evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (translationFeatures and timeOptions) in the function call to CulturalTranslator_translateInteraction, instead of limiting the call to only the required parameters (sourceLanguage, targetLanguage, content, contentType), leading to a mismatch and failed execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of just \"Paris\" as required; this caused the evaluator to reject the function call due to a mismatched argument, despite the function name being correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in its CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This prevented successful evaluation despite correct product and competitor details."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call included an extra unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" with value \"shallow,\" which caused the output to not match the expected function signature for CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments and led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and arguments, but incorrectly specified \"analysisDepth\": \"detailed\" instead of the required \"analysisDepth\": \"basic,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of just \"Tokyo\" as required by the function, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the enhancement settings, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function name and parameters, but the argument keys used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\", causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected format. This schema mismatch led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The failure was caused by a mismatch in the case of the \"targetGroup\" parameter value (\"Finance Department\" vs. \"finance department\"), resulting in a strict evaluator not recognizing the function call as matching the expected output. The agent should have normalized the parameter value to match expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the tool call inside an XML-like <tool_call> tag rather than as a plain JSON object or valid tool-call format, leading to a parsing failure despite the arguments themselves being correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"estimated_time\" field in each task object, which was not part of the expected input schema, causing a mismatch with the required function signature and resulting in the function call not being accepted."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"#008000\" (a darker green), instead of the required \"#00FF00\" (bright green) as the primary color. This mismatch in color value caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"influence\" argument in its function call to cultural_event_classical_music_impact, resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented successful execution. Only the parameters \"period,\" \"composer,\" and \"date_range\" were expected."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent used user-provided values for password, security question, and answer instead of extracting or inferring the expected new password and security information from the prompt or available data. It also failed to use the precise expected parameters required for the resetPassword function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"userPreferredCategories\" parameter in the updateUserProfile function call, which is not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failure to make a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to recognize the need to compute shipping costs directly from the provided user context and package details, resulting in no attempt to fulfill the core task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the correct category \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories in the addToCart function call, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for password, userPreferredLoginTime, and loginFrequency, and included irrelevant parameters not present in the expected call. It failed to map or infer the user's actual preferences and recent password correctly."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent provided a function call to updateUserProfile with argument values that did not precisely match the expected data—specifically, it altered the user's email and location fields beyond what was required, instead of retaining and formatting them exactly as specified in the ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent used \"Books, Sports\" for UserPreferredCategories instead of the correct \"Wellness\" preference, causing the function call to mismatch the expected parameters despite correct tool and other arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the correct \"Bronze\" status, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call in the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to extract or infer the updated email and city from context and did not attempt a function call, instead prompting the user for details despite the benchmark including the necessary information in the task setup."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call semantically but failed due to a capitalization mismatch in the \"OrderName\" field (\"Mexican Meal\" vs. expected \"Mexican meal\"), causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile function; instead, it responded conversationally and requested more information, ignoring the expected tool-use pattern and failing to execute the necessary profile update action."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent failed to disambiguate between two available processPayment functions and did not specify the intended function version, resulting in no exact function call match according to the evaluator's expectations."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect capitalization and partial match for the restaurant name (\"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of \"small burger place by the elm park\"), resulting in a function call that did not align with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included both \"Vegetarian\" and \"Gluten-Free\" as the UserDietaryPreference instead of only \"Gluten-Free,\" which was expected. This resulted in a parameter mismatch, causing the function call to fail to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent used \"OrderName\": \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized) instead of the expected \"dinner order\" (lowercase), causing the function call not to match exactly with the expected parameters. This minor casing discrepancy led to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used the restaurant name \"Japanese restaurant\" instead of the correct \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\" and provided an irrelevant value (\"General cuisine without any dietary restrictions\") for UserDietaryPreference instead of null, causing a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sushi Platter\" for the OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order\" as specified in the expected function call, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required fields \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus\" in the submitReview call, despite being asked to include loyalty status and with enough context to infer dietary preferences as \"None,\" leading to a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent did not use the correct restaurant name (\"My favorite Korean joint\") or dietary preference (\"Spicy\") from the user's request, and instead used an incorrect restaurant (\"Kimchi Palace\") and omitted the specified dietary style, leading to the mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required Amount parameter in the processRefund function call and used \"Original Method\" instead of the user's actual preference (\"Store Credit\"). This prevented a correct match with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Nut-Free\" for the UserDietaryPreference instead of \"Low Sodium\" as specified in the menu item name and user intent, leading to a parameter mismatch in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required tool function (\"updateUserProfile\") and instead responded only with a text message, not performing the necessary action to update the user's home location as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the UserDietaryPreference field by combining \"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\" into a single string, rather than specifying only \"Vegetarian\" as expected, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call signature."}

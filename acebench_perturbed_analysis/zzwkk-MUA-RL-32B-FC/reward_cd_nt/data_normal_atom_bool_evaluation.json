{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported argument (\"include_legal_requirements\": true) in its ExportRegulationAdvisor function call, which prevented an exact match with the expected parameters, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported argument \"include_trending_colors\": false to the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and preventing a match by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected call signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"include_attachment\" to false instead of true in the function call, failing to include the project details as an attachment as required by the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary parameter (\"provide_indoor_options\") in the function call, resulting in a signature mismatch and no exact match with the expected function call that only required \"hiking_location\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter (\"include_graphical_analysis\": true) in the function call to TaxPolicyImpactSimulator that was not part of the expected parameters, leading to a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent failed to exactly match the expected parameter value (\"document with the detailed training schedules of top players like Federer and Nadal\"), instead paraphrasing it. The evaluator requires precise parameter matching for function calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported parameter (\"include_demographic_info\": true) to the AudienceSegmentationTool call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in no valid function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument (\"include_weekend_rules\": true) to the DailyTrafficRuleNotifier function call, causing it not to match the expected function signature and resulting in no valid invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"consider_temperature\" in the function call, which does not match the expected function signature for ClothingRecommendationBasedOnWeather that only accepts \"city.\" This caused the call to not match and fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the optional parameters (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true instead of false, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected default (all false) parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The model included unsupported parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") in the function call, rather than only the required \"zone_identifier\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected, minimal function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The model used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the expected \"Amazon rainforest\" for the area_identifier argument, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter validation and resulting in failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and parameters, but mismatched the capitalization of the \"industry\" value (\"Technology\" instead of \"technology\"), causing the function call not to match the expected output."}

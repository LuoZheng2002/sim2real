{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"Saturday\" as the dayOfWeek argument based on \"this weekend\" instead of the required \"Sunday\" in the expected output, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name but provided parameter values with capitalized initial letters (\"Millennials\", \"Fitness\") instead of the required lowercase format (\"millennials\", \"fitness\"), leading to a mismatch during function call validation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"targetAudience\" parameter not present in the expected function call, causing a mismatch with the required \"businessGoals\" and \"featureRequirements\" structure for TemplateRecommender_suggestTemplates. It failed to conform to the tool's strict input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and parameters but formatted \"imageCount\" as a string instead of an integer, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature. This type error led to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the appropriate registration function—instead of making a tool call, it requested unnecessary user information and responded in natural language only, ignoring the direct registration request and available tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\") in the function call and failed to include them in its output, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"comparisonType\": \"year-over-year\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to fulfill the task as specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_45", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with appropriate arguments, but failed due to a case mismatch: it used \"Technology\" instead of the expected \"technology\" in the sectorList parameter, causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as matching."}

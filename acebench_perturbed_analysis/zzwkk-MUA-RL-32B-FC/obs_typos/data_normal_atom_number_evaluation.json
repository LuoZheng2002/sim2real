{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the available tool's signature. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" should have been used."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_8", "analysis": "The agent misspelled \"the\" as \"teh\" in the novelDraft argument, causing a mismatch with the expected function call that contains the correct spelling, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a specific age value (25) instead of representing the requested audience as the lower bound (20) of the 20-30 age range, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"radius\" parameter in the FindNearbyMedicineDisposal function call, which does not match the tool's required signature and caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameters \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment\" in its EconomicDevelopmentMetrics function call, providing only \"industrialOutput\" instead of all three expected arguments as required by the task and available data."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the receptionDelay parameter to 10 instead of the expected 1200, failing to accurately represent the user's implied experience of significant message delays. This led to an incorrect function call that did not match the evaluator's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected signature, which only accepts \"companySymbol\" and \"analysisPeriod.\""}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"details\" argument ({\"cuisineType\": \"Japanese\"}) in the function call. The function only accepts \"country\" and \"context\" parameters, causing a mismatch with the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters and failure to match the benchmark's expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"additionalOptions\" parameter not specified in the function signature and output the \"data\" parameter without the trailing period. As a result, the function call did not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value (\"Louvre\") for the \"museumId\" parameter instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum,\" causing the function call to not match the expected input. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_15_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted incorrect arguments for the function call: it used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" as the top-level property, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call despite otherwise correct content."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of just \"Paris\" as required. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary and empty \"exhibitionType\" parameter and included \"Paris, France\" instead of the expected \"Paris\" in the \"location\" field, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the extra \"translationFeatures\" object with feature flags in the function call arguments, which is not supported by the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in the function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_28_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"method\" field (\"standard biodegradable wrapping\") in the \"packagingOptions\" argument, deviating from the expected function schema which only accepts the \"material\" subfield. This caused the function call mismatch and failure to execute."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"securityOptions\" at the top tool-call argument level instead of nesting it within each \"customerInfo\" object in the data array, leading to a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extraneous parameter \"analysisDepth\" in the function call, which was not part of the expected parameters. This caused the function call to not match the expected schema, leading to a failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Tokyo, Japan\" instead of just \"Tokyo\" for the \"destination\" parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and leading to the failure despite otherwise correct parameter handling."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The failure occurred because the model returned the correct function call and parameters, but the capitalization of the string \"valuation summary for properties involved\" in the \"details\" field did not match the expected output (\"Valuation summary for properties involved\"), leading to a mismatch per the strict evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a typo mismatch in the task name (\"Read time mangement book\" instead of \"Read time management book\"), causing the function call parameters to not exactly match the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent made a typo in the program name (\"Gold Benfits Club\" instead of \"Gold Benefits Club\"), causing the function call to not match the expected output exactly. All other details were correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent misspelled \"improvements\" as \"improvments\" in the survey question text, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}

This mismatch caused the function call arguments to not match the expected values."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the function call incorrectly by placing the parameters directly in the root arguments instead of wrapping them inside the required \"votingContext\" object, resulting in a schema mismatch and function call error."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"time_range\" field for each weekday in \"time_restrictions\", instead of just specifying the days as required. The function call arguments did not match the expected schema, leading to evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper object and altered the sample IDs (\"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\") in its function arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"feedback_options\" parameter to the publicSpeaking_coach function call, which is not supported by the available tool's API. The function call should have only included the updated session_details as specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent omitted the explicit availability value \"iOS, Android, Web\" for the fireworks safety app in its function call, instead using the nonstandard phrase \"all platforms,\" which did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unsupported parameter \"session_length\" when calling mood_enhancing_playlist_generator, instead of matching the expected parameters (current_mood and favorite_genres) only, leading to a mismatch with the tool's defined signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" which caused the function call parameters to mismatch the expected output, leading to evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The model placed the gear information at the top level of the function call instead of nesting it under hikingDetails, resulting in a payload structure that does not match the expected function signature and thus failed to invoke the tool correctly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_25", "analysis": "The agent omitted the 2024 data point in the function call, failing to include all required years (2019–2024) as specified by the updated user request and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent wrapped its JSON tool calls inside <tool_call> tags and used \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters\" field, producing invalid and unparsable JSON for the evaluator. This format deviation caused the compliance check calls to fail parsing."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected parameters and thus was not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, omitting the required separate analysis for indirect employment; it should have made two function calls, one for each employment type (direct and indirect), but made only one."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" parameter at the top level of the function call arguments instead of inside the \"customer\" object as required by the expected function call schema, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\":\"Advanced\" to the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function schema and resulting in evaluator rejection despite otherwise correct parameterization."}

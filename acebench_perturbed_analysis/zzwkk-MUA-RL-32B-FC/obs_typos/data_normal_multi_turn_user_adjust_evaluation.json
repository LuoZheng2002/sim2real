{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_0_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call contained a typo in the \"content\" argument (\"laucnh\" instead of \"launch\"), causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_3_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"travel_dates\" field in the user_preferences parameter of the virtual_travel_guide function call, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_2", "analysis": "The agent's submitted review contained a typo (\"necesssary\" with three 's' instead of \"necessary\") in the comments field, causing the function call not to match exactly with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_11_1", "analysis": "The agent correctly used the SocialMediaAdGenerator_createImageAd function with all required parameters, but misspelled the word \"unforgettable\" as \"unforgetable\" in the description, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's expected parameters and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"feedbackId\" parameter with the value \"most-recent\" when calling PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback, leading to a parameter mismatch with the tool's expected input."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The model outputted the function call using <tool_call> tags instead of the required <tool_call>...</tool_call> XML markup, causing the evaluator to not recognize the action as a valid tool call. The action content and arguments were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, failing to assign specific permissions to the roles or enable auditing as required by the user's request and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The model's function call contained a typo in the \"reviewReason\" field (\"to ensuer compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), causing it not to match the expected parameters exactly and leading to the evaluator's failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\" and a \"form_title\" in its function call output that are not part of the expected schema, causing the function call signature to not match exactly and failing the evaluator’s strict matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"insuranceOptions\" field outside of the \"rentalOptions\" object, instead of nesting it within \"rentalOptions\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent returned the repaymentOptions for \"credit card\" in a different order (\"lump sum\" before \"installments\") than expected. The evaluator required the exact sequence, leading to the function call mismatch. The agent failed to preserve the original order of user-provided options."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent included an incorrect location string (\"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of \"Trastevere\") and misspelled the dish name (\"raviolli\" instead of \"ravioli\"), causing its function call to fail to match the expected schema and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent invented a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\") and location (\"Rome\") instead of using the user's preference for a generic \"traditional Italian trattoria\" near the Colosseum, resulting in mismatched function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked only the input validation tool instead of using the TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate function to calculate the innovation rates for teams with transformational leaders as required by the user’s request and the available data."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\") in the function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string, while the expected output was just \"breakfast.\" This mismatch in preferences text caused the evaluator to treat the function call as non-matching, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"activityLevel\" field in the touristPreferences, which is not part of the expected function parameters. This caused a mismatch in function argument structure, leading to the evaluator rejecting the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call matches the expected information, but the agenda parameter's capitalization (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs. \"Finalize and sign the contract\") differs, likely causing a strict evaluator mismatch. The agent failed to preserve the expected title case formatting."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the unchanged \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updatedToolSettings for the communicationModule, instead of only specifying the updated \"method\": \"Email\" as required by the function's expected input structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110) instead of the lowest available option that covered all requested categories ($120.5), resulting in a travel budget calculation that didn't match the user's specified coverage requirements."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_48_0", "analysis": "The agent misspelled \"How satisfied are you with the product?\" as \"How satisfed are you with the product?\" in the function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and a failure to recognize a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" outside of \"user_preferences\" and capitalized destination IDs (\"PARIS\", \"TOKYO\") instead of using \"Paris\" and \"Tokyo\", causing a function call argument structure mismatch with the expected schema."}

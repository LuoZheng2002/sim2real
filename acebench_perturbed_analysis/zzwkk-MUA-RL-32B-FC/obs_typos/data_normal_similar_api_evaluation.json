{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent fragmented symptoms by listing \"crying a lot\" as an additional symptom and \"decreased appetite\" as baby_behaviors, instead of aggregating both into the structured fields and accurately reflecting \"constant crying and decreased appetite\" in the baby_behaviors parameter."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_5", "analysis": "The agent used the misspelled input string \"Thsi\" instead of the correct \"This\" from the user's prompt, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call. This caused the evaluator to treat the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent generated incorrect parameter values for strategy_selector_a: competitor_analysis, customer_demographics, and evaluation_criteria content and structure did not match the expected schema and wording, resulting in a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct function call with appropriate arguments, but it paraphrased \"AI control\" as \"struggle for control between human authorities and autonomous AI systems\" instead of using the expected concise term \"AI control,\" leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_b instead of task_schedule_a, and used parameters mismatched with the original API's format, failing to follow the tool specification and expected function call for scheduling the additional task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The model failed to match the expected function call due to paraphrased argument values rather than using the required canonical phrases (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" vs. \"technology and renewable energy\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch for strict evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose syntax_parsing_b instead of the required syntax_parsing_a for the French sentence, failing to match the tool use expected despite syntax_parsing_a being available and appropriate for the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent made a typographical error in the \"clothing_needs\" field (\"casul\" instead of \"casual\") and in the \"body_type\" value (\"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\"), causing the function call arguments to not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the parameter \"activity_level\" in the health_tips_a function call, which was not expected or supported, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call lacked the detailed, context-rich problem description required—it simply repeated the earlier phrasing instead of including the added user clarifications and requests for diverse, overlooked perspectives as specified in the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of the required analyze_social_data_b function, as specified in the available tools and expected output for evaluating \"buying tendencies\" with F1 score. This shows a failure to select the correct function."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unsupported parameter, \"touch_navigation,\" in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, which does not match the tool's expected parameters and caused evaluator rejection. Only \"responsive_design\" and \"load_speed\" should be present."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent failed to correct the typo \"noets\" to \"notes\" in the poem_text argument, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no recognized function call. The essential error is not normalizing or correcting the user input as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" for the relation and added extra context (\"causing tension\") in the status field, deviating from the expected, more concise format. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The model's function call used \"The importance of love\" for the \"theme\" argument instead of the required \"importance of love\", causing a parameter mismatch and preventing an exact match with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent supplied extra detail (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") for the current_brand_status parameter instead of matching the expected concise value (\"not well-known\"), leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The model incorrectly capitalized the \"title\" parameter value (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" instead of \"AI applications in oncology\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the context object in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature that only allows \"culture\" in the context."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_4", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize or correct the obvious typo in the customer's question (\"Wat\" instead of \"What\"), resulting in a function call argument that did not exactly match the expected parameters, hence not passing the benchmark's strict matching criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added an extraneous \"safety_checks\" field to the locking_mechanism parameter, deviating from the expected function signature for adjust_seat_safety and causing the output to mismatch the required schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in no match being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent over-specified the protocol parameter by including a \"details\" field with authentication steps and benefits that are not part of the accepted function signature, causing the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent output the genre parameter as \"pop\" (lowercase), but the expected genre was \"Pop\" (title case). This case sensitivity mismatch led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra \"eventTypes\" argument to the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, which was not part of the function's expected parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_29", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"equipment\" argument in its function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected call format and causing evaluator rejection despite correct core information."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"features\" field with an empty list in the \"simulation_parameters\" object, causing a strict parameter schema mismatch and resulting in the function call not matching the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with one intensity setting, instead of handling all three audio files with their respective correction intensities as requested in the user prompt."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent returned function calls with the correct locations and dates, but it formatted the year \"100 AD\" as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required zero-padded \"0100-08-01\", causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_39", "analysis": "The agent only called the function for the first date range and failed to make a second call for the July 10-12 range, thus not fulfilling the user's request for both periods."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent output the date range in a natural language format with a misspelling (\"Janury 1, 2023\") instead of the required ISO format (\"2023-01-01\"), resulting in no function calls matching the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON by appending an extra closing brace, causing parsing failure. It also used an unnecessary <tool_call> wrapper instead of providing the expected structured function call, violating output formatting requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters into a single call to WebSecurity_EncryptionManager, as required by the function's interface and the expected output."}

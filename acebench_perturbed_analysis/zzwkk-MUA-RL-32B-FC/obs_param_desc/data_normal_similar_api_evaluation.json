{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to use the tool that specifically handles vein visibility combined with persistent symptoms, as described in the question and required by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments diverged from the required format and details, with mismatches in customer demographics, business goals phrasing, and evaluation criteria keys/values, resulting in no exact match to the expected function call for strategy_selector_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent over-specified the conflict_element by providing a lengthy description instead of using the succinct term \"AI control\" as required by the expected function parameters, leading to a mismatch in the function call argument."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_b instead of task_schedule_a, failed to match parameter names and formats (e.g., used \"priority\": \"Urgent\" instead of \"High\", \"duration\" instead of \"estimated_time\", and incorrect resource keys), and did not adhere to the previously used API."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent paraphrased user inputs (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\", \"substantial savings, property ownership, minimal debt\") instead of copying them verbatim as expected, leading to a strict mismatch with the required function call parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the syntax_parsing_b tool, despite the sentence containing only ASCII characters; it should have used syntax_parsing_a as expected. The root cause is failure to match tool choice criteria based on input characters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extraneous \"activity_level\" parameter in its function call to health_tips_a, which only expects \"preferences\" and \"age\"; this mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent provided an insufficiently detailed problem description to clarity_guide_b, failing to incorporate system state and actions already taken, as required. This mismatch led to no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"analyze_social_data_a\") instead of the required \"analyze_social_data_b\", which was the only valid tool for this step, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the Mobile_optimize_site function call. Only \"responsive_design\" and \"load_speed\" are valid; the extra argument caused a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The model output did not match the expected function call due to minor differences in the relation field (\"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\") and the status field (added extra detail \"causing tension\"), preventing an exact match by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"The importance of love\" instead of the expected \"importance of love\" for the 'theme' parameter, causing a mismatch and failure to align with the expected invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent modified the \"current_brand_status\" parameter to \"fairly new and currently not well-known\" instead of using the expected value \"not well-known,\" causing the function call parameters to not match exactly with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in the case of the \"title\" parameter (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs. \"AI applications in oncology\"), which caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected output."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the function call arguments incorrectly by omitting the required \"votingContext\" wrapper object, instead placing parameters at the top level. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified detailed time ranges for each weekday instead of simply restricting encryption to the listed days, resulting in a function call argument format that did not match the expected structure and failed to match the tool's schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"monumentDetails\" wrapping key in its function call and did not use the full sample IDs (\"Sample A\", \"Sample B\"), resulting in a function signature mismatch that failed to meet the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"feedback_options\" parameter in the function call, which was not part of the expected parameters, leading to a mismatch. Only \"session_details\" should have been provided in the call to publicSpeaking_coach."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent paraphrased \"all platforms (iOS, Android, Web)\" as \"all platforms\" instead of the required explicit listing (\"iOS, Android, Web\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. All other details were handled correctly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"session_length\" parameter in the function call that is not part of the accepted parameters for mood_enhancing_playlist_generator, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" (as stated in the user's request) to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the required parameters for correct tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" list inside the top-level arguments instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function's expected parameter structure, resulting in a mismatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The model outputted a function call using a non-standard argument structure (\"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\"), leading to the evaluator not recognizing it as a valid function call for Community_Skill_Sharing_Platform_Integration_Tool. The proper schema was not followed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the JSON tool calls inside non-JSON <tool_call> tags and used an extra closing bracket, resulting in invalid, unparsable output instead of providing a clean JSON array of function calls as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard function call. This caused a schema mismatch with the expected output, leading to evaluator failure despite correct overall logic and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and omitted the required separate analysis for indirect employment, thus failing to make two distinct function calls—one for direct and one for indirect employment—as the task demanded."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"time\" and \"complianceRules\" as separate top-level parameters rather than nesting \"time\" inside the \"customer\" object and omitting \"complianceRules\", resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent failed to nest the location and routes under the required \"user_preferences\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatched argument structure compared to the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\":\"Advanced\" in its function call, causing a mismatch with the expected schema for the content_moderation_analysis tool and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}

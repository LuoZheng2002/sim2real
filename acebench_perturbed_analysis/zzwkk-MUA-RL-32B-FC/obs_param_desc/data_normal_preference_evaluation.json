{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the resetPassword tool despite having all required information present in the user's request, instead prompting the user to provide details that were already implied or expected, resulting in no function call being made."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile function and instead responded with a text-based follow-up request for information, ignoring the instruction to update the profile using tool calls, resulting in no tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to identify that the user's request was for a shipping cost calculation, not a preference retrieval. It did not extract and use relevant entities needed for the shipping cost function."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing the function call not to match the expected format and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent added extraneous parameters (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and changed the required values (\"password\", \"userPreferredLoginTime\") from those expected, instead of strictly using the correct minimal fields with the right values for the loginUser function."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required updateUserProfile tool, instead responding in natural language without issuing any tool calls. This prevented any profile updates from being executed as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books, Wellness\" instead of only \"Wellness\" as required by the expected function call, causing a parameter mismatch that prevented successful tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the user's actual membership tier, \"Bronze\", leading to a mismatch with the expected function call arguments. It failed to retrieve or infer the correct membership status before requesting the shipping cost."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent only provided the updated home location and omitted required profile fields (name, email, language, time zone, birthday) in the updateUserProfile call, failing to construct a complete and valid function request as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent included the unit \"inches\" in the \"PackageDimensions\" parameter instead of the required format \"12x8x10\" without units, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to trigger the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the \"updateUserProfile\" tool and instead asked the user for more information, missing the direct execution of the required function call despite having sufficient data in context."}
{"id": "normal_preference_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter value, defaulting to \"Standard\" instead of retrieving and using the user's true status (\"Silver\") as implied by the context or required by the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The model's function call arguments have a minor capitalization mismatch in the \"OrderName\" field (\"Mexican Meal\" vs. expected \"Mexican meal\"), leading to a strict match failure even though all substantive parameters are correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the user's email to \"jessica.new@example.com\" and password to \"Jessie90#new\" instead of maintaining the provided \"jessica.l@example.com\" and \"Jessie90#\" from the user profile, resulting in mismatched parameters in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the value of \"OrderName\" (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call despite all necessary parameters being present."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in the UserDietaryPreference parameter, while only \"Gluten-Free\" was specified as an expected dietary/allergic preference. This mismatch caused the function call arguments to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the \"OrderName\" parameter as \"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call argument formatting and leading to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese Restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and erroneously included the \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter, which was not required or expected, leading to a schema mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the required \"sushi order\" for the OrderName parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required UserDietaryPreferences and UserMembershipStatus fields in the submitReview parameters, despite the user's explicit request to include dietary preferences and loyalty status in the review submission."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" rather than the user's \"favorite Korean joint\" for RestaurantName, and set UserDietaryPreference to \"Korean\" instead of reflecting the dietary style (\"Spicy\"), leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent’s function call to processRefund omitted the required Amount parameter, resulting in an incomplete function call that does not match the expected tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserDietaryPreference parameter to \"Nut-Free\" instead of the required \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align with the \"Low Sodium Grilled Chicken\" menu item and the user's implicit preference."}

{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") into a single string for the UserDietaryPreference parameter, instead of using only the specified \"Vegetarian\" value as expected by the tool's input format."}

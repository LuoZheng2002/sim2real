{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in the capitalization of beneficiary names and relationships (\"User\" vs \"user\", \"Grandchild\" vs \"grandchild\"), causing the model's function call not to match the expected output exactly."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_5", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect argument structure: it included an invalid artwork_id (\"waterfall_001\" instead of \"Waterfall\") and added unnecessary fields (\"historical_context\") not expected by the tool, failing to match the required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent output the time_frame values in ISO datetime format with times included, instead of the expected simple date strings (\"YYYY-MM-DD\"), resulting in a mismatch with the tool’s required input schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used the literal string \"techdataapi\" as the sourceId instead of the required sourceId value \"1\", resulting in a function call parameter mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and parameters, but formatted the timeRange values with a \"Z\" timezone designator and included seconds, differing from the expected ISO string format without \"Z\" or seconds, causing a mismatch in function call normalization."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters into a single call to WebSecurity_EncryptionManager as required by the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used the wrong campaign title, set the age range maximum to 30 instead of 35, and used 2024 dates instead of the expected 2023 dates. These parameter mismatches prevented the function call from matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent’s function call omitted the required \"historical\" field and did not include \"source_id\" for each \"traffic_source\" in the traffic_data argument, leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent formatted the function call correctly and chose the right tool, but literal string matching failed because the imageData argument value did not match the expected placeholder text, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Free Play\" activity from the morning routine, failing to fully incorporate all user-specified requirements into the function call to FamilyRoutineManager_createMorningRoutine."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_54", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a minor case sensitivity mismatch in the \"industry\" parameter (\"Software\" instead of the expected \"software\"), leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The model's function call used \"Green Tea\" (capitalized) for teaName instead of \"green tea\" (lowercase), resulting in an argument mismatch that caused evaluator failure. The error stems from improper canonicalization/normalization of the teaName parameter."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_59", "analysis": "The agent included an extra closing curly brace in its tool call JSON, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed. This formatting error prevented the tool call from executing despite otherwise correct parameter selection."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"readingLevel\" parameter in the \"userProfile\" object, which was not expected in the function signature; this caused a mismatch and the function call was not recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent outputted an extra closing brace in its JSON, resulting in invalid JSON syntax that could not be parsed. This formatting error caused the tool call to fail despite otherwise correct parameter extraction."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_69", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra, empty \"speciesDetails\" field to the function call arguments, which does not match the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the vibration_patterns field inside app_details rather than at the top level of the function's parameters, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent specified \"23:59:59\" instead of the expected \"23:59:00\" for the end time in the timeWindow parameter, causing the function call to not exactly match the required format and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the tool call JSON in extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags, leading to parsing failure. Only a valid JSON object was expected; the added tags caused invalid output that could not be parsed."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_84", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"fontWeight\" in the \"typographyPreferences\" argument, causing its function call not to match the expected schema, which only allows \"fontFamily\"."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"process_info\" field within the \"plastic\" details, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call schema. This deviation led to failure in matching the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_88", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its function call by omitting a closing brace, causing a parsing failure. This indicates inadequate output formatting controls, not a misunderstanding of the requested information or function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect siteId (\"Great Wall - Beijing Segment\") instead of the required \"Great Wall Beijing\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This deviation caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}

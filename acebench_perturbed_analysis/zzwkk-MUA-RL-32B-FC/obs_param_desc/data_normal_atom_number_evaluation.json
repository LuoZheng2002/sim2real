{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter when calling ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent used an invalid ageGroup value (25) instead of the specified and expected value (20), failing to match the required function call parameters for accurate audience analysis."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"radius\" parameter to the FindNearbyMedicineDisposal function call, which expects only \"latitude\" and \"longitude,\" causing the function call not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_24", "analysis": "The agent omitted spaces after the commas in the \"foodOptions\" string (\"chicken,lentils,almonds\" instead of \"chicken, lentils, almonds\"), causing a strict argument mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This minor formatting issue led to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent called EconomicDevelopmentMetrics with only the industrialOutput parameter, omitting serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment, which were required based on the user’s initial request and the expected function input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent invoked the correct function but used an incorrect and unrealistic value for \"receptionDelay\" (30 instead of the expected and more plausible 1200), failing to align its function call with the problem context described by the user."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, which expects only \"companySymbol\" and \"analysisPeriod,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}

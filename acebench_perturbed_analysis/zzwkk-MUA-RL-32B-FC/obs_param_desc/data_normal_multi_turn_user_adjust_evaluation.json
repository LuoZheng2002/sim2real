{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_12_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"past month\" for the timeFrame parameter instead of the expected \"last month.\" The tool likely requires a specific, standardized time descriptor, and \"past month\" did not match, causing the function call not to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_11_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"duration\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the function's expected schema, causing the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching rather than processing it."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call within custom XML-like <tool_call> tags and included an extraneous closing curly brace and linebreak, resulting in invalid JSON formatting. This caused the evaluator's JSON parser to fail, as it expects a pure, well-formed JSON object with no extra characters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"feedbackId\": \"most-recent\" parameter in the function call, which was explicitly requested based on the user's instruction, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of the required securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl function, thus failing to set the specified permissions and audit configuration as requested in the task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly supplied \"to ensure compliance\" as the reviewReason instead of \"ensure compliance,\" failing to exactly match the user's phrasing. This led to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call, causing the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent placed \"insuranceOptions\" at the wrong hierarchical level in the function call arguments; it should be inside \"rentalOptions\", not as a separate argument, leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"form_title\" and \"feedback_type\" parameter, which are not part of the expected or supported parameters for the manage_feedback_collection function, causing a mismatch and resulting in a failed function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Rome\" in the \"location\" parameter as \"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of just \"Trastevere,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call format. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" instead of the expected \"installments\" as the optionType in repaymentOptions, causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters schema. This prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent fabricated a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\" in \"Rome\") instead of using the user's explicit preferences for a \"traditional Italian trattoria\" near the Colosseum, failing to match the required broad but accurate constraints in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the validation function instead of invoking the required TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate function to calculate innovation rates, thus failing to perform the main task specified in the user query."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Beta\") in its function call, causing a mismatch with the expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The model included an extra key (\"activityLevel\") in the \"touristPreferences\" object that was not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the required parameters for RuralRetreatOrganizer_scheduleCulturalActivities."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in the \"preferences\" parameter: the model output \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast,\" resulting in an exact match failure for function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call mismatched the expected output due to incorrect capitalization in the agenda parameter (\"finalize and sign the contract\" instead of \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing the evaluator to treat them as different calls."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" in the updatedToolSettings for communicationModule, instead of only updating the \"method\" to \"Email\" as requested. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110 instead of the correct $120.5 per person matching the SafeTravel Co. quote previously provided) when calculating the travel budget, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"existing_conditions\" fields for each traveler and the \"duration\" field in coverage_options, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and was rejected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter in its function call, failing to specify algorithm and forecasting preferences as expected for the \"travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals\" tool. This made the function call incomplete and unmatched by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly rephrased \"10 years of industry experience\" as \"10+ years industry experience\" in desired_qualities, causing a mismatch with the function's expected strict parameter value and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" at the top level of the arguments instead of nesting it inside \"user_preferences,\" and also used different capitalization for destination IDs (\"PARIS\" and \"TOKYO\" instead of \"Paris\" and \"Tokyo\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the context for the poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer function, resulting in a function call that did not match the tool’s required parameter schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra top-level parameter, \"printTime\", in the function call arguments, which was not part of the expected function schema, leading to a parameter structure mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary protocol \"details\" fields in the function call that were not part of the expected parameters, causing the call to not match the required schema. It failed to restrict arguments strictly to the tool's specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent specified the genre parameter as \"pop\" (lowercase), while the expected function call requires \"Pop\" (capitalized). This mismatch caused the system to not recognize the function call as valid, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter in the checkParameters argument, leading to a function call signature mismatch with the available tool, which only accepts the \"timeFrame\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"eventTypes\" argument not specified or supported by the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function, resulting in no matching function call for evaluation. It should have used only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" parameters as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"equipment\" field with an empty list in the function call arguments, deviating from the expected parameter structure, which only required \"sport_type\" and \"session_details.\" This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"features\" field (as an empty list) in the \"simulation_parameters\" object, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only submitted one function call for a single audio file with extra feedback parameters, instead of making three separate function calls—one for each audio file and correction intensity—thus failing to process all user-provided recordings as requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent correctly used the TimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress function but formatted the year for \"100 AD\" as \"100-08-01\" instead of the expected four-digit \"0100-08-01\", causing a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the required ISO date format (\"YYYY-MM-DD\") for the start_date and end_date fields, outputting month names instead, leading to a function call argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for tasks that should have been combined into a single call with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption specified together, as the tool is designed to handle both operations in one invocation."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unnecessary \"details\" parameters (\"cuisineType\" and \"meetingType\") in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the function's expected signature, which only requires \"country\" and \"context\". This caused the evaluator not to recognize or match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected tool invocation signature. This omission led to the function call being unrecognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the \"museumId\" parameter in the MuseumExplorer_getExhibitInfo function call, causing a mismatch with the expected invocation and resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly omitted the period at the end of the data string (\"Confidential Business Strategy\" instead of \"Confidential Business Strategy.\") in its function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"Paris, France\" for the location instead of just \"Paris\" as required by the function signature, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in a failure to recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"translationFeatures\" argument in the function call, which is not part of the expected function signature. This caused a mismatch and failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" instead of just \"Paris\" for the \"location\" parameter, which did not exactly match the expected function call parameters, resulting in the benchmark's call matching system failing to recognize the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in the CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_28_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"method\" field (\"standard biodegradable wrapping\") within the \"packagingOptions\" argument, deviating from the required function signature, which expects only the \"material\" key. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the function call. Only \"demographicFilters\" was expected; the extra argument caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to reject the output as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The root cause is a capitalization mismatch in the \"details\" field of the integrationOptions parameter (\"valuation summary for properties involved\" vs \"Valuation summary for properties involved\"), leading to the function call not matching the expected output exactly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used #008000 (a darker green) instead of the expected green shade #00FF00 for the primary color, failing to exactly match the user's implied preference for a bright green. This caused the function call to be mismatched and not accepted."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"required\" field in the function arguments, which is not part of the specified function schema. This caused the function call to not match the expected format, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra parameter (\"influence\": [\"opera\", \"symphony\"]) that is not part of the expected or required function signature, resulting in a function call mismatch and failure to fulfill the evaluator's expected format."}

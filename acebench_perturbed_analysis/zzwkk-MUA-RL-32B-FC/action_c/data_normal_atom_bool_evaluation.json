{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"include_legal_requirements\" in its function call, which did not match the expected parameters for ExportRegulationAdvisor, resulting in a mismatch and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_6", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (\"warranty_check\" and \"include_support_contact\") in its FreeRepairInquiry_service function call, causing it not to match the expected function signature which only accepts \"customer_id\" and \"purchase_receipt\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"include_trending_colors\" which is not part of the function signature; this caused a mismatch with available tool schemas, leading to the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\" parameter in its function call to TimeManagementAssistant_designSchedule, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failing to fully address the user's request for a balanced schedule."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to make the required function call and instead only described its intent and asked the user unnecessary clarifying questions, rather than executing the expected action using the available ConfidentialEmailService_sendEncrypted tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter (\"provide_indoor_options\": true) in the function call that was not part of the expected schema for HikingWeatherAdvisor, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the extra argument \"include_graphical_analysis\": true, which is not part of the expected parameters for the TaxPolicyImpactSimulator function, resulting in no exact match between the function call and the benchmark specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"pattern_detection\", \"include_visualization\", \"focus_on_physical_training\") to the EliteTennisTrainingPatterns function call instead of only passing the required \"training_routine_data\" parameter as specified in the tool's expected interface."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"include_demographic_info\": true) in the AudienceSegmentationTool function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the function call not to be recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"include_weekend_rules\" to the DailyTrafficRuleNotifier function call instead of only passing the required \"area_code\" parameter, resulting in a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"consider_temperature\" parameter to the ClothingRecommendationBasedOnWeather function call, instead of invoking it with only the \"city\" parameter as required by the available tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the analysis flags (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true, while the expected output required all these flags to be false. The function call parameters did not match the required settings."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") to the OceanicBiodiversityData_fetch call, instead of only providing \"zone_identifier\" as required by the tool specification, resulting in a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the correct parameter value \"Amazon rainforest\" for area_identifier, causing an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}

{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameter \"include_indoor_suggestions\" in the WeekendWeatherChecker function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. It should have explicitly set \"include_indoor_suggestions\" to false."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent used \"Technology\" (capitalized) instead of the expected lowercase \"technology\" for the industry parameter, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required resetPassword function and instead just asked the user for missing parameters. It did not attempt a tool call, even though the information needed for the function was available in the prompt."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile function and instead only generated a textual response requesting information. It did not interact with any tools or attempt to update the user profile as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost, failing to recognize that shipping cost calculation was required using the provided package dimensions, shipping method, user location, and membership status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"UserPreferredCategories\" as \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods,\" causing the function call not to match the expected parameters and resulting in evaluator rejection. All other fields were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"UserPreferredContactMethod\" to the updateUserProfile function call, which does not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject the call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent added extra, unsupported parameters (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and used an incorrect password and login frequency, deviating from the user's typical values. This resulted in a function call that did not exactly match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated the user's email to \"jessica_newemail@example.com\" instead of retaining \"jessica.l@example.com\" and misrepresented the home location as \"Near Austin, TX\" instead of \"a town near Austin, TX.\" This led to mismatched function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed the string \"Books, Wellness\" for UserPreferredCategories instead of just \"Wellness\" as expected, causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters and resulting in no valid matching call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Platinum\" as UserMemberStatus instead of the ground-truth \"Bronze,\" failing to match the user's actual profile and causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the new home location, omitting required fields like UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday. The function call was incomplete and did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_20", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the calculateShippingCost function as required, and instead incorrectly attempted to fetch user payment method preferences, ignoring the question's explicit focus on shipping cost calculation using provided package dimensions and membership status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the \"updateUserProfile\" function and instead prompted the user for information, missing the opportunity to execute the expected tool call with the available or assumed data."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called loginUser instead of processPayment, failing to address the user's explicit payment request and disregarding necessary parameters like order details, payment method, and loyalty status required by the processPayment function."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile function and instead responded conversationally, asking the user for new information without issuing any tool calls, resulting in no action being taken to update the profile."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"Dinner Order\" in the OrderName parameter, while the expected parameter was \"dinner order\" (lowercase). This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Burger Place by Elm Park\") instead of the expected (\"small burger place by the elm park\"), leading to a mismatch and failure to retrieve the intended reviews."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included both \"Vegetarian\" and \"Gluten-Free\" in UserDietaryPreference, while only \"Gluten-Free\" was specified in the expected function call; this mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The root cause is a case mismatch in the \"OrderName\" parameter: the model output \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected \"dinner order\", causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching. All other arguments were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and added an unnecessary \"UserDietaryPreference\" field instead of leaving it null, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the expected \"sushi order\" for the OrderName parameter, leading to a mismatch with the required function call format and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required parameters \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus,\" failing to include the user's dietary preferences and loyalty status as requested and expected by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" as the RestaurantName instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" from the user's request, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect parameter values for the refund: it selected the wrong refund amount (15.99 instead of 350) and the wrong refund preference (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\"), failing to align with expected user data or context."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Nut-Free\" as the UserDietaryPreference instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to accurately incorporate the user's stated dietary requirement into the function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required function call and instead responded with a conversational reply, neglecting to use the <tool_call> tag or trigger the available updateUserProfile tool as specified by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") into a single string instead of providing only the expected \"Vegetarian\" value for \"UserDietaryPreference\", leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}

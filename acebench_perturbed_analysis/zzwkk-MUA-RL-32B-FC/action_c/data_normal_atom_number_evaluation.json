{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, resulting in a call signature that did not match any available tool definition and thus was rejected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the ageGroup argument as 20-30 (a range) instead of a single integer value as required, resulting in invalid JSON syntax and an unparsable function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"radius\" parameter in the FindNearbyMedicineDisposal function call, which was not expected by the API; only \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"riskAppetite\" parameter in the function call, which is not supported by the TechStockInsightGenerator tool according to the expected parameters, leading to a mismatch and failure to execute the function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent called the EconomicDevelopmentMetrics function with only the industrialOutput parameter, omitting required parameters serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment that were relevant to the user's request and needed for a complete comparison."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent called the correct tool but set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 10 instead of the expected 1200, failing to correctly capture or infer the appropriate delay value from context or user input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" argument in the function call to StockTrendEvaluator, which only accepts \"companySymbol\" and \"analysisPeriod\" parameters, causing the evaluator to reject the function call due to a parameter mismatch."}

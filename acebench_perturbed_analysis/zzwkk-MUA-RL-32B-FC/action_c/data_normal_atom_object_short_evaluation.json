{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the context when calling poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, resulting in a non-matching function call format compared to the expected parameters. Only \"culture\" was expected in context."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"tilt\", \"safety_checks\", \"adjustment_time\") to the function call, instead of only updating the required fields (\"tilt\" under seat_position) per the expected schema, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter \"printTime\" in the function call arguments, which did not match the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the call even though all correct arguments were otherwise provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unnecessary and overly detailed \"details\" field to the \"protocol\" argument. The function only expects \"type\" and \"time\" fields, leading to a schema mismatch and failure to match the required call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a case mismatch in the \"genre\" parameter (\"pop\" instead of \"Pop\"), leading to no matching function call recognized by the evaluator, as parameter values must exactly match the expected case-sensitive strings."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the expected or tool-defined schema, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter to the checkParameters object, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema. Only \"timeFrame\" should have been provided within checkParameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a call signature mismatch with the expected tool input, which only accepts \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"equipment\" argument (an empty list) in its function call, resulting in a call signature mismatch with the expected parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included an unnecessary \"features\" key with an empty list in the \"simulation_parameters\" object. This caused its function call signature to differ from the expected one, resulting in no match being found."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"instructorPreference\" field in the MindfulSessionScheduler_scheduleYogaStream function call, which was not specified by the user and not expected by the benchmark, resulting in a parameters mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra arguments (\"sources\" and \"keywords\") that are not part of the expected function signature, causing its function calls not to match the specification and resulting in evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with \"light\" intensity and ignored the other two recordings with \"medium\" and \"heavy\" intensities, thus failing to generate the three required function calls for all user-provided files."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to zero-pad the year in \"100-08-01\" to \"0100-08-01\", resulting in a parameter mismatch with the required function signature for the date format. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The model formatted the date range in natural language (\"January 1, 2023\") instead of the required ISO format (\"2023-01-01\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_49", "analysis": "The agent output the tool call wrapped in invalid XML-like tags and used extra closing curly braces, producing malformed JSON that could not be parsed, rather than returning a direct, properly formatted JSON tool call as required."}

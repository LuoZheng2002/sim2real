{"id": "agent_multi_turn_11", "analysis": "The agent failed to turn on Wi-Fi before attempting actions that require network connectivity, such as logging in to the food delivery platform and sending messages. As a result, these actions did not actually succeed, causing the world state to diverge from expectations."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to enable Wi-Fi before attempting actions that require connectivity, such as logging in, placing orders, and sending messages. This resulted in tasks not being executed successfully and the world state not updating as expected."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_13", "analysis": "The agent failed to delete the unrelated milk tea message (Message ID 3) and did not send the required cost message to Frank after placing the order. As a result, the message inbox and world state were incorrect."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to query the correct food price for the Margherita Pizza from Domino's (which is 68 yuan) and instead used an incorrect price of 85 yuan when sending the final cost message to Frank, leading to an incorrect message and world state."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the period at the end of the message content (\"The price of the purchased goods is 198.0 yuan.\") when sending the message; this caused a mismatch in the actual message saved versus what was expected."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_17", "analysis": "The agent sent a message when the inbox was full without first deleting a message to make space. As a result, the new message was never actually added to the inbox, causing the final state to lack the expected sent message."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_18", "analysis": "The agent sent the message \"The total price for two Fresh Gift Packs is 198 yuan.\" instead of following the exact required format \"The price of the purchased goods is 198.0 yuan.\" as specified in the reminder, leading to a mismatch in the inbox content."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to deduct the flight cost (1600 CNY) from Frank's (user2) bank balance after booking the return flight, resulting in an incorrect user account balance and thus an incorrect world state after the reservation."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly modified the reservation to another MU5678 flight (same flight number, wrong time), instead of changing it to the correct flight CZ4321 at 20:00—the actual evening option available—failing to select the proper flight from search results."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_27", "analysis": "The agent failed to book available connecting flights by segments even when explicit user instruction was given. Although flights existed on July 18th from Beijing to Nanjing and from Nanjing to Shenzhen, the agent incorrectly reported no availability and never attempted to reserve these flights."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly booked 4 pieces of baggage instead of the maximum 3 allowed for business class, causing an invalid reservation and an incorrect deduction from the user's bank balance. The agent should have adjusted the baggage to 3 as per policy."}

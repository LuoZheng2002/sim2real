{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_1", "analysis": "The agent misplaced the \"timeFrame\" field outside the expected \"queryDetails\" object, causing its function call arguments to mismatch the required schema and fail validation against the expected structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call by placing the parameters directly at the top level instead of nesting them inside a \"votingContext\" object as required by the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unnecessary \"time_range\" fields within \"time_restrictions\" for each weekday, instead of just specifying the applicable days as required. This resulted in a function call signature mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call by passing \"monumentID\" and \"materialSamples\" as top-level arguments instead of nesting them inside a \"monumentDetails\" object as required by the function schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent outputted malformed JSON for the tool call by including an extra closing brace, resulting in invalid syntax that could not be parsed and thus failed to schedule the alarm as instructed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent included a \"feedback_options\" parameter in the function call that is not part of the expected or supported parameters for publicSpeaking_coach, resulting in a non-matching function call and failure to execute the intended action."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped \"all platforms\" to the safety app's availability instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" as required, resulting in a parameters mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included an unsupported \"capacity\" field in the function arguments, which does not match the expected schema for GlobalCulturalEventPlanner. This caused the function call to fail validation against the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature that only accepts \"current_mood\" and \"favorite_genres\" within \"user_preferences\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"frequency\" field (\"frequency\": \"weekly\") in the retraining_schedule argument, causing its function call to not match the expected schema and be rejected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to exactly reproduce the required meeting topic (\"Launch of our new product\") in the function call, instead paraphrasing it as \"New Product Launch Discussion.\" This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information outside of the \"hikingDetails\" object, whereas the function signature expected \"gear\" to be nested inside \"hikingDetails.\" This schema mismatch prevented the function call from matching the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent failed to make the required function/tool call and instead only discussed its intent in natural language, requesting additional information rather than proceeding with the setup using the available information. No tool invocation was performed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call arguments, omitting the required \"beverage_details\" wrapper object around the beverage information. This resulted in arguments not matching the expected schema for beverage_compliance_check."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field for the \"summary\" widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected schema that requires \"settings\" to be present, even if empty."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a separate function call for indirect employment, as explicitly requested in the user's question; thus, it did not fully address both aspects as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra \"complianceRules\" fields in the function call arguments, deviating from the expected parameter schema. This caused the calls not to match the required signature and resulted in failure to be recognized as valid function calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" in the function call, causing it to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluator rejection despite otherwise providing the correct arguments."}

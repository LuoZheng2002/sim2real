{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Saturday\" for the \"dayOfWeek\" parameter instead of \"Sunday\" as required by the expected output, leading to a mismatch in function call arguments and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The agent failed due to capitalization inconsistencies in the parameter values (\"Millennials\" and \"Fitness\" instead of the expected lowercase \"millennials\" and \"fitness\"), resulting in a mismatch with the evaluator's strict string matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"targetAudience\" as an argument in the TemplateRecommender_suggestTemplates function call, which is not part of the accepted parameters, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_15", "analysis": "The agent included an extraneous \"beginner\" option in the sessionOptions array, which was not expected—instead, only \"45 minutes\" should have been specified according to the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided the \"imageCount\" argument as a string (\"10\") instead of an integer (10) and capitalized \"Winter\" instead of using the expected lowercase (\"winter\") for \"seasonNames\", causing a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required OnlineFitnessClass_register tool and instead asked the user for more information, missing the clear instruction to register for a beginner's yoga class. It did not make any tool call as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters \"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\" in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function input signature. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the output as a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_45", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but used \"Technology\" (capital T) in sectorList instead of the expected lowercase \"technology,\" resulting in a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter case sensitivity."}

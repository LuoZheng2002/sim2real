{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"details\" field (\"cuisineType\": \"Japanese\") in the function call arguments. Only \"country\" and \"context\" are expected, so the function call did not match the required signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call's structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted its tool call inside an XML-like <tool_call> tag and used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\", both causing JSON parsing to fail and the structure to differ from the expected purely JSON tool invocation format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the required signature; only \"data\", \"encryptionMethod\", and \"logActivity\" should have been specified."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect value \"Louvre\" for the \"museumId\" parameter instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum,\" failing to match the expected function call schema and causing the function call not to register as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of just \"Paris\" as expected by the function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" instead of just \"Paris\" for the location parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in evaluation failure. Proper normalization of location input was not performed."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") to the function call, deviating from the required schema. This caused no exact match to the expected function signature, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in its CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"securityOptions\" object at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it inside each customer data entry under \"data\". This does not match the required schema for CustomerDataManager_storeSecureData."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the analysisDepth parameter to \"detailed\" instead of the required \"basic,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature for reputation_sentimentAnalysis."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"analysisDepth\" argument not present in the tool's specification or the expected function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the function call to be rejected as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent passed \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination, but the expected argument was just \"Tokyo\". This mismatch in the \"destination\" parameter prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the function call to TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent produced the correct function call and parameters, but did not match the expected output format exactly—specifically, it used \"arguments\" in its tool_call instead of \"parameters,\" causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_31_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call within XML-like <tool_call> tags, causing parsing failure. It should have provided only valid JSON per the API schema, without extra delimiters, to ensure proper function call execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"#008000\" (a dark green) as the primary color instead of the required \"#00FF00\" (bright green) explicitly expected based on the user's request for \"green\" and the benchmark's specified output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"targetGroup\": \"Finance Department\" with uppercase letters, while the expected parameters required \"targetGroup\": \"finance department\" in lowercase, leading to a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"estimated_time\" field in each task object, which is not accepted by the goal_set_priority_tasks function schema, resulting in no matching function call being found. Only \"task_name\" and \"priority\" were expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"influence\" parameter (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in its function call, which does not exist in the function schema, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the tool call inside a non-standard <tool_call> XML tag instead of the required pure JSON format, causing a parsing failure. The actual argument structure was correct, but the formatting violated the expected output protocol."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call to cultural_tour_experience, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the failure."}

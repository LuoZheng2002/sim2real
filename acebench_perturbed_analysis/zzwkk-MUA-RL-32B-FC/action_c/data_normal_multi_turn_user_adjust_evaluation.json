{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to submit the required review using the DecisionAudit_submitReview function, instead only retrieving decision details. It did not act on the user's provided review comments and approval as explicitly requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool and parameters but incorrectly set the year to 2023 instead of the expected 2024, failing to align with the likely intended travel year based on the conversation context and temporal relevance."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent output valid JSON for the tool call but included extra closing characters (\"}\" and \"</tool_call>\") outside the JSON, causing parsing failure. This indicates improper formatting rather than a reasoning or function-calling logic mistake."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the required IDs (\"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the unsupported \"feedback_type\" and \"form_title\" parameters in the manage_feedback_collection call, leading to no exact match with the expected function signature and causing function call validation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the word \"to\" at the beginning of the reviewReason (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of using the exact user-provided string (\"ensure compliance\"), causing the function call arguments not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"latest\" instead of the required \"most-recent\" value for the feedbackId parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input and failure to trigger the correct function execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent listed \"lump sum\" before \"installments\" in the repaymentOptions array for the first debt, whereas the expected output requires \"installments\" first. The order of options was not preserved, leading to the mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"endDate\" instead of the expected \"checkOutDate\" as a key in the \"stayDuration\" parameter, resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"insuranceOptions\" as a top-level parameter instead of nesting it within \"rentalOptions\", resulting in a function call argument structure that does not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"auditEnabled\": true parameter in its securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl function call, resulting in an incomplete request that did not match the expected schema for configuring access control with auditing enabled."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Rome\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Trastevere, Rome\") instead of just \"Trastevere\" as required. This caused the function call not to match the expected parameters, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent fabricated a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\") instead of booking at a generic \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" near the Colosseum as instructed, resulting in a mismatched function call not aligned with the user's request or the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called only the validation function to check leader types instead of proceeding to calculate innovation rates with TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate for teams led by transformational leaders, failing to perform the requested calculation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent erroneously added the phrase \"with breakfast included\" to the preferences parameter instead of matching the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast,\" causing the function call arguments to differ from the ground truth expectation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The model outputted the correct schedule_meeting function call but used a lowercase agenda value (\"finalize and sign the contract\") instead of matching the expected capitalization (\"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing a strict evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called the function leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders, failing to use the appropriate tool for directly comparing the two leaders' visionary traits as requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified budget range of $1000–$2000 and instead used an incorrect, much lower range of $100–$200 when calling book_accommodation. This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to modify both the communication and impact analysis modules, instead of updating only the communication method from Slack to Email as requested. It included unnecessary fields in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110) in the travel budget calculation instead of the expected $120.5, likely failing to select the correct insurance option (SafeTravel Co.) as presented in the prior system message."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in its function call: it did not include the \"existing_conditions\" list for each traveler and the \"duration\" in \"coverage_options,\" both of which were necessary for a correct match to the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent reformulated a desired quality from \"10 years of industry experience\" to \"10+ years industry experience,\" causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter check and resulting in no matching function call detection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed travel_dates at the top level of the function arguments, instead of nesting it inside user_preferences as required by the function schema, resulting in a schema mismatch and failed function call."}

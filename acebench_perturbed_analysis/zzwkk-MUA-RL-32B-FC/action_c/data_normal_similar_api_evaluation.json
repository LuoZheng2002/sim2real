{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent's function call had mismatched argument values: the \"additional_symptoms\" and \"baby_behaviors\" fields did not closely mirror the expected \"excessive crying\" and \"constant crying and decreased appetite,\" likely causing the evaluator's strict match check to fail."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent outputted the temperature range as \"18-25\" instead of \"18 to 25\" as expected. This string mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call, despite the rest of the arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments did not sufficiently match the required parameter formats and values—particularly in competitor analysis, customer demographics, and evaluation criteria—which caused the evaluator to not recognize the call as matching, despite correct tool selection."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent's function call provided an overly specific and paraphrased \"conflict_element\" (\"struggle for control between human authorities and autonomous AI systems\") instead of the expected concise parameter value (\"AI control\"), leading to a mismatch with the benchmark’s required function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_17", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter, \"stress_level,\" in the function call to balance_helper_b, which was not expected or supported by the tool's specification, leading to a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_b instead of the required task_schedule_a function and supplied all four tasks rather than only scheduling the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task with the correct transformed parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The function call argument \"investment_preferences\" incorrectly includes the word \"sectors,\" and other arguments are paraphrased rather than closely matching the expected canonical phrases, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters for finance_advisor_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the syntax_parsing_b tool instead of the required syntax_parsing_a tool for parsing the French sentence, failing to match the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"medium build\" instead of the required \"medium\" for the body_type parameter, causing a function call schema mismatch and preventing proper evaluation despite otherwise correct parameter extraction."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra, unsupported argument \"include_statistics\" in the function call to eco_vision_B, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to match any available tool."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"activity_level\" parameter in the function call to health_tips_a, which only expected \"preferences\" and \"age\", causing the call not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call lacked sufficient detail and diversity in the problem description, failing to synthesize or expand on possible overlooked areas and perspectives as expected for the clarity_guide_b tool, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature which only requires \"responsive_design\" and \"load_speed\". This caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent called poetry_analysis_b instead of the required poetry_analysis_a function, failing to select the correct tool as specified by the task requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" for the relation and included extra context (\"causing tension\") in the status field, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters and no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent included extra detail in the current_brand_status argument (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") instead of matching the expected succinct value (\"not well-known\"), causing a function parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"details\" parameter (director) in the function call, instead of matching the expected parameters (\"title\" and \"year\") for movie_summary_a, causing a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The function call's \"title\" parameter capitalization (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs \"AI applications in oncology\") does not match exactly with the expected answer, causing the evaluator to treat it as a mismatch. The agent failed to preserve the requested parameter case."}

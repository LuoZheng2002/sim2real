{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"Saturday\" as the dayOfWeek parameter instead of \"Sunday\" as required by the expected function call. This deviation resulted in a mismatch and caused the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"radius\" parameter in the DR_OT function call, which does not match the expected signature and led to no recognized function call, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_8", "analysis": "The root cause is a casing mismatch; the agent used capitalized values (\"Millennials\", \"Fitness\") instead of the expected lower-case (\"millennials\", \"fitness\"), leading to function call parameter mismatch and no match found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"targetAudience\" in its TR_T function call, which was not expected according to the function's signature; this led to no match with the evaluator and thus a failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"beginner\" as a session option argument instead of only \"45 minutes,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema for YP_S, which only accepts \"45 minutes\" in sessionOptions."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The model failed to match the function call due to a capitalization mismatch in the parameter \"seasonNames\" value (\"Winter\" vs. expected \"winter\"), leading to no valid function call being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_26", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"timeZone\" parameter in its CAQI_D function call, whereas the tool only accepts \"cityNames\". This caused a mismatch with the required function signature and resulted in no valid function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call any function or tool—instead, it responded with a request for more user information, ignoring the available registration tools and not initiating the appropriate registration action as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\") in its GAQ_C function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature and thus failure to execute the correct tool call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"visitDuration\" parameter in the DFP_R function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected input, which only required \"childrenAges.\""}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_45", "analysis": "The agent used \"Technology\" with a capital \"T\" for the sectorList value instead of the expected lowercase \"technology,\" causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter value check."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required password reset tool (\"P\"). Instead, it prompted the user for information that should have already been available, resulting in no tool call and thus not fulfilling the user's password reset request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to perform any tool call to update the user's profile, instead asking the user for information that was either already provided or could be inferred, thus not using the available UP function as required."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of invoking the SC function, which was explicitly designed to calculate shipping cost using the parameters provided in the question. It failed to recognize and use the relevant function for shipping cost calculation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent mismatched the parameter \"UserPreferredCategories\" by using \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods,\" causing the function call to not match the expected output. This parameter normalization error led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed both the password and login frequency values and used \"Jessie90#new\" and \"Weekly\" instead of the provided \"Jessie90#\" and \"Daily,\" failing to use the correct user credentials as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect email address (\"jessica_newemail@example.com\" instead of the expected \"jessica.l@example.com\") and did not accurately reflect the user's location wording (\"Near Austin, TX\" instead of \"a town near Austin, TX\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books, Wellness\" instead of the correct value \"Wellness,\" failing to filter or prioritize based on the relevant category for a yoga mat as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct user member status (\"Bronze\") in the SC function call, instead using \"Standard,\" resulting in a function call that does not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to initiate any tool call and instead asked the user for more information, despite the question already implying the required data should be updated. It did not generate the expected <tool_call> output for the UP function."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent called the function P with correct arguments, but mismatched the casing of \"Mexican Meal\" instead of \"Mexican meal\" for OrderName, causing the function call to not match exactly and resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed because it did not make the required tool/function call (specifically to the UP function) to update the user's profile; instead, it only responded conversationally and asked for new information, missing the execution step."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of the expected, more descriptive \"small burger place by the elm park\" as the RestaurantName parameter, failing to match the exact function arguments required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in the UserDietaryPreference parameter, which was not present in the expected input; only \"Gluten-Free\" should have been used. This mismatch caused the function call arguments not to match exactly, resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized) instead of \"dinner order\" (lowercase) for the OrderName parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and evaluator's strict matching."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and unnecessarily included the UserDietaryPreference parameter, which should have been null, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of \"sushi order\" as required by the expected function call, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields (\"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus\") in its function call to R, resulting in a mismatched function signature and failure to meet the tool's parameter requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" as the restaurant name and \"None\" for dietary preference instead of using \"My favorite Korean joint\" and the user's \"Spicy\" dietary style, thus failing to accurately extract and map the required entities from the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent set the refund Amount to 0 instead of 350 and specified the wrong refund preference (\"Original Method\" instead of the user's preference, \"Store Credit\"), resulting in a non-matching function call to R."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Nut-Free\" as the UserDietaryPreference instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align with the user's intent to add a low sodium dish. The function call parameters did not accurately reflect the requested dietary preference."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke any function call, instead responding with a text-based clarification question. It should have called the \"UP\" tool to update the user's home location as per the available functions."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"UserDietaryPreference\" argument by combining \"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\" as a single string instead of providing just \"Vegetarian\" as required. This prevented the function call from matching the expected parameters."}

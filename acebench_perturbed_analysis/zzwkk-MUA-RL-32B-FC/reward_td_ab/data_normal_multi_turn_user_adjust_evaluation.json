{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function (CBE_E) and parameters except for the date range, where it incorrectly used 2023 instead of the correct year 2024 as specified in the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted the function call in its own <tool_call> XML-like tags rather than the required <tool_call> tags specified by the system/evaluator, leading to the evaluator not detecting any valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1 instead of PFM_F, failing to use the expected function for feedback analysis on John Doe with the specified parameters (\"employeeId\" and \"feedbackId\"). This indicates improper function selection and incorrect argument handling."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend\" instead of \"sales_trends\", and \"inventory_level\" instead of \"inventory_levels\") in the function call, which did not match the required parameters, resulting in no matching function call being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter in its M_F_C function call that was not expected, causing a mismatch with the required function signature and thus failing to match the expected function call despite all other parameters being correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the expected value (\"ensure compliance\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_33_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called MilestoneTracker_integrateWithCalendar_1 instead of the required MT_WC function, failing to match the expected tool despite both offering similar functionality. It did not use the precise tool specified in the expected protocol."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of the required MAPI_AC function, and also omitted specifying permissions and audit configuration, failing to match the required access control and auditing setup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only created the new 'Supervisor' role with inheritance and omitted the previously defined 'Admin' and 'User' roles; it should have included all three ('Admin', 'User', 'Supervisor') in the MAPI_UR call per user request and prior context."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent provided the correct data and function call but did not preserve the order of the \"repaymentOptions\" array as required; this resulted in no exact match with the expected output and caused the evaluator to flag the function call as incorrect."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent fabricated the restaurant name as \"Trattoria near Colosseum\" instead of using the generic description \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" and separate \"location\" as \"near the Colosseum\", leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Rome\" in the location (\"Trastevere, Rome\") instead of the expected \"Trastevere\", causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters. This discrepancy led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called ValidateLeaderInput_checkLeaderType instead of invoking the TIM_IR function, which was required to calculate innovation rates for teams with transformational leaders based on the provided data."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Trastevere cooking class venue\" as the destination instead of the expected \"Trastevere.\" The function call argument didn't match exactly, leading to no match even though the intent was correct. The agent failed to use the precise, expected location string."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\" within the function arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the required \"teamName\" values in the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string instead of matching the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call, resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call matches the parameters but failed due to a capitalization mismatch in the \"agenda\" field (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs. expected \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing the evaluator to reject it as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"leadership_analyze_visionary_traits\") instead of the required \"L_C_T_L\" function that specifically compares two leaders as expected. It failed to select and call the correct tool for the comparative analysis task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary changes to the \"impactAnalysisModule\" settings when only the \"communicationModule\" method (from Slack to Email) should have been modified, resulting in a function call with extraneous parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used an insurance cost of $110 instead of the relevant $120.5 from the presented insurance options, failing to select and propagate the appropriate per-person price when calculating the total trip budget."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the accommodation booking budget to $100–$200 instead of the user-specified $1000–$2000, failing to carry forward the correct budget constraint into the B_A function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call: it did not include the \"existing_conditions\" field for each traveler (should be empty arrays), and did not provide the \"duration\" field in \"coverage_options\", leading to a mismatch with the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to faithfully transmit the user's specified desired qualities (\"10 years of industry experience\" and \"excellent communication skills\"), instead paraphrasing them as generic terms (\"industry experience\", \"communication skills\"), which caused a mismatch in the function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed travel_dates as a top-level argument to V_T_G instead of nesting it within user_preferences, resulting in a function call signature mismatch against the expected parameters."}

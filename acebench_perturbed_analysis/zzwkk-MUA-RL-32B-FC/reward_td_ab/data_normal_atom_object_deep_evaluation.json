{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included specific full-day time ranges for each weekday in the time_restrictions field, rather than simply listing the weekday names as required by the function signature. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleID fields, providing \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\", resulting in a function call that does not exactly match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent generated invalid JSON for the tool call, introducing an extra closing brace at the end. This syntactic error prevented the expected tool invocation from being executed or parsed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent called the correct type of function (\"publicSpeaking\" coaching) but selected \"publicSpeaking_coach_1\" instead of the required \"S_C\" function, despite both offering similar services. It failed to use the function name expected by the task constraints."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent called \"GlobalCulturalEventPlanner_1\" instead of the required \"GCEP\" function, despite both offering the same capability. It failed to select the correct function name from the available tool list, leading to a mismatch with the benchmark's expectations."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The root cause of the failure is that the model included an extra, unsupported parameter (\"session_length\") in the function call to M_E_P_G, causing it not to match the expected function signature and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent altered the meeting topic from \"Launch of our new product\" to \"New Product Launch Discussion\" instead of preserving the user's wording, causing the function call to not match the expected parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information inside the top-level arguments object instead of nesting it under \"hikingDetails\" as required by the expected function signature for AP_HP. This argument structure mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_25", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function—CareerTrendAnalyzer_analyzeJobMarket_1—instead of the required CTA_JM function, even though both had similar descriptions. The test specifically expected a CTA_JM function call with the provided data."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"capacity\" parameter in the CAC_CP function call, which was not expected. This led to a mismatch with the expected function signature and caused the function call not to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent outputted tool calls in a non-JSON format by wrapping them with <tool_call> tags, causing a JSON parsing failure due to invalid syntax and extra trailing characters. Tool calls should be output as strict JSON objects without additional markup."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not structurally match the expected parameters and caused the evaluator to not recognize it as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only made a single function call for \"Direct\" employment, but the question required analysis for both \"Direct\" and \"Indirect\" employment impacts. It failed to issue a call for the \"Indirect\" employment category."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"time\" field incorrectly inside the \"customer\" object instead of as a separate field at the root level of the GC_CL function call parameters, resulting in unmatched function signatures."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_44", "analysis": "The agent only called the function once for the first function in the list, ignoring four other required evaluations. It failed to generate separate function calls for each requested function and evaluation scenario."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" in the C_M_A function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only \"content\" and \"context\" were accepted parameters."}

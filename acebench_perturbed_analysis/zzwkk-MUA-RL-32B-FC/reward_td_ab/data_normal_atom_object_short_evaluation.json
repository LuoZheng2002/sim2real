{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in its P_T_E_A function call; only \"text\" and \"context\" with \"culture\" are valid, leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The model added unsupported and extraneous parameters (\"safety_checks\" and \"adjustment_time\") to the A_S_S function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected call schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"printTime\" parameter in the A_PE function call and unnecessarily wrapped tool parameters in an additional \"materialSettings\" object, resulting in a mismatched function signature and failure to match the expected call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included extra, non-schema \"details\" under the \"protocol\" parameter in the DC_B call, resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected schema exactly and was therefore not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"genre\" parameter as \"pop\" (lowercase), while the expected value was \"Pop\" (capitalized), causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter to the CA_O function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call recognized by the evaluator. Only \"content\" and \"checkParameters\" with \"timeFrame\" were expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"eventTypes\" parameter to the CTG_T function call, which was not expected per the tool's specification. The function should only have included \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call arguments by nesting them under \"cloud_parameters\" and \"simulation_parameters\" keys, instead of passing all parameters at the top level as required by the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unnecessary \"instructorPreference\" field to the MSS_YS call, deviating from the expected parameters. The function call did not strictly match the required arguments, leading to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (\"sources\" and \"keywords\") in the T_F_L_A_D function calls, instead of matching the expected signature which only required the \"date_range\" parameter, leading to a schema mismatch and no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with \"light\" correction instead of handling all three recordings with their respective correction intensities, failing to generate the required three function calls—one for each audio and intensity combination."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"specificDate\" for the Colosseum as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required four-digit year \"0100-08-01\", causing an exact parameter mismatch and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"dataOptions\" parameter to the WF_DF function call, resulting in no exact match with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call. Only the required location and time parameters should have been included."}

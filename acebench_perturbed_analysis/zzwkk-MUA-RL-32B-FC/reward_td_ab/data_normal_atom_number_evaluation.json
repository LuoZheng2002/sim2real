{"id": "normal_atom_number_5", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"connectionType\" parameter in the SHDI function call instead of only passing the required \"deviceID\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the STE function call, resulting in no exact match with the expected argument schema. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" were expected, so this extra parameter caused the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent formatted the ageGroup parameter incorrectly using a numeric range (20-30) instead of an integer value as expected (20), resulting in invalid JSON and a parsing error."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"radius\" parameter to the FNMD function call; only \"latitude\" and \"longitude\" are valid, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in the error."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"riskAppetite\" parameter in the TSIG function call, making it not match the function signature expected by the evaluator. Only \"industry,\" \"daysToAnalyze,\" and \"predictionDays\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent's function call to EDM included only the industrialOutput parameter, omitting the required serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment parameters, resulting in an incomplete and invalid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (MRC) with the correct device and app version but used an incorrect value for receptionDelay (10 instead of the expected 1200), indicating it failed to infer or ask for the user's actual delay experience."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary \"details\" field with \"cuisineType\" in its function call to CNE_EG, deviating from the required parameters \"country\" and \"context\" only. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\" field (\"Immediate\") in the function call to IP_TRO, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and thus the evaluator did not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter in the DG_BD function call, resulting in a function signature mismatch; only the specified parameters (\"data\", \"encryptionMethod\", \"logActivity\") were expected. This caused the function call to be unrecognized and the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter in the ME_EI function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function arguments and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_19_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Paris, France\" as the location parameter, while the function AE_E expects only \"Paris\". This parameter mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected format, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (translationFeatures) to the CT_I function call that were not part of the expected schema, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of just \"Paris\" as required by the tool's expected input, resulting in a mismatch and failure to trigger the appropriate function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"analysisDepth\" parameter to \"detailed\" instead of the required \"basic\" value, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in the CPA_P function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function arguments and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unrecognized parameter \"analysisDepth\" to the CDM_CS function call, which caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and prevented the evaluator from matching the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Tokyo, Japan\" as the destination instead of \"Tokyo\" as expected by the tool signature, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to correctly invoke the T_C_E_A function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"timeOfDay\": \"noon\" parameter in the TIO_B function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent's tool call argument structure did not match the expected \"parameters\" key format—using \"arguments\" instead—causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call and resulting in a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The failure was due to a parameter mismatch: the function call used \"targetGroup\": \"Finance Department\" instead of the expected lowercase \"finance department\", causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the G_S_P_T function call, which is not part of the expected parameters. Only \"task_name\" and \"priority\" were required, causing a mismatch with the expected call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent selected \"#008000\" (a darker shade of green) as the primary color instead of the correct \"#00FF00\" as specified by the user preference for \"green.\" This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted a tool call in raw JSON format wrapped in XML-like tags, which likely caused parsing issues. It should have returned a valid function call object, not textual serialization, to ensure proper downstream execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"influence\" argument in its call to the C_E_C_M_I function, deviating from the expected parameter schema and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}

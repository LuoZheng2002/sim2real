{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"baby_health_check_A\" instead of \"B_H_C_B\"), failing to select the function specifically designed for assessing vein visibility with associated symptoms, as required by the user's question."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The model failed because it output the temperature range as a string with a hyphen (\"18-25\") instead of matching the required format (\"18 to 25\"), causing the evaluator to not match the function call despite all other arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong function, calling \"phrase_interpret_b\" instead of the required \"P_I_A\" tool to interpret the phrase, despite \"P_I_A\" matching the expected schema and being available with the fastest response time."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call in a non-JSON-compliant format by wrapping the JSON in <tool_call> tags, causing a parsing error. Additionally, it failed to align field names and parameter values with expected formats, such as inconsistent demographic details and evaluation criteria terminology."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the conflict_element as \"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\" instead of the expected concise value \"AI control,\" leading to a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"task_schedule_b\") instead of the required \"T_S_A\" and attempted to reschedule all tasks instead of only adding the new one with the mapped priority and correct parameter format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"confidence_boost_b_1\" instead of the expected \"C_B_B\" function. It failed to select the correct tool as required, despite both serving similar purposes, thus not matching the evaluator's expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called vlookup_step_guide_1 instead of V_S_G, failing to match the required tool name for the step-by-step VLOOKUP guide as specified in the available tools and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent altered the parameter \"investment_preferences\" from \"technology and renewable energy\" to \"technology and renewable energy sectors,\" causing a mismatch with the exact function signature expected and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the \"syntax_parsing_b\" tool instead of the required \"S_P_A\" tool as specified by the ground truth, failing to match the expected function call despite \"S_P_A\" being the appropriate, faster function for ASCII sentences."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"body_type\": \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\" for the S_R_A function call, causing a mismatch with the required parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong tool (\"health_tips_b\") instead of the expected \"H_T_A\" and omitted the required \"age\" parameter in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's problem description in the C_G_B function call was too minimal and did not incorporate the detailed context, steps already taken, or the explicit request for diverse perspectives as required by the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the analyze_social_data_a function instead of the required A_S_D_B function after the user's follow-up request, failing to switch to the expected tool despite their similar capabilities and descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the M_O_S function call, which does not match the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent selected the function poetry_analysis_b instead of the required P_A_A function, failing to match the expected tool usage despite identical input parameters. The core issue is incorrect function/tool selection."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent outputted the relation type as \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" and added extra subjective detail (\"causing tension\") to the status, resulting in a function call parameter mismatch with the expected ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly paraphrased the \"current_brand_status\" parameter as \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of using the required value \"not well-known,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent correctly selected the M_AG function and supplied appropriate parameters, but the function call was not formatted to match the expected parameter key casing (used \"title\" instead of \"title\" exactly as required) or failed to match the required JSON structure precisely, causing evaluator mismatch."}

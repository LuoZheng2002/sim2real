{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called DecisionData_retrieveDetails instead of DecisionAudit_submitReview, failing to submit the user's feedback and approval as required by the user's instructions and the task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call used paraphrased feedback comments rather than exactly matching the expected review comments, leading to a mismatch with the evaluator’s strict text comparison and resulting in a failure to detect the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_10_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the tool call by placing the function name and its arguments inside a single \"name\" field as a string, instead of using an \"arguments\" (or equivalent) field with structured parameters as required by the tool-calling protocol."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_3_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the user's interest from \"historical significance\" to \"historical sites\" in the function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature for virtual_travel_guide."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent returned the tool call outside of the required <tool_call> XML tags, violating the output format expected by the evaluator. As a result, the evaluator could not detect any function call despite correct function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"feedbackId\" parameter (\"most-recent\") in the function call, failing to specify which feedback should be analyzed as instructed, thus not matching the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"feedback_type\" in the manage_feedback_collection function call, causing the output not to match the required function signature. This deviation prevented the function call from being recognized and executed."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent copied the user's phrasing for tasks and objectives verbatim instead of generating the required canonical/standardized wording expected by the benchmark, resulting in mismatched function call parameters and failure to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_33_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the MilestoneTracker_integrateWithCalendar function to sync the milestones with the specified Google Calendar, instead only retrieving the schedule; it ignored the user's explicit intent to integrate the schedule with their calendar."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_2", "analysis": "The agent gave a generic improvement area (\"communication skills\") instead of specifying the two distinct areas (\"verbal communication\" and \"written communication\") as identified in the feedback analysis, failing to granularly translate feedback into actionable training recommendations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked the function to set up user roles instead of the required function to configure access control and assign specific permissions and audit settings, thus failing to address the core access control configuration requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"Admin\" and \"User\" roles in the securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles call, only specifying the \"Supervisor\" role with \"inheritsFrom\" set to \"Admin\", instead of the full roles list as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent submitted the review with the reviewReason \"confirm compliance\" instead of the required phrase \"ensure compliance,\" resulting in a parameters mismatch and a failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_status\" as widget IDs instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in failure to match the API signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent placed \"insuranceOptions\" outside the \"rentalOptions\" object instead of nesting it correctly within \"rentalOptions,\" resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent booked a specific restaurant (\"Trattoria Da Enzo\" in Rome) instead of following the user's request for a classic Italian trattoria near the Colosseum, as specified in the expected parameters. It ignored location and type preferences."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"location\" parameter to \"Rome, Trastevere\" instead of just \"Trastevere\" as required by the function schema, causing an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in the team names (\"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta\"), resulting in incorrect function call parameters that don't match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called only the validation tool instead of the required innovation metrics calculation tool. It failed to process the provided innovation data for transformational teams and did not invoke TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent provided the repaymentOptions in a different order from the expected output. The evaluator requires the repaymentOptions to match exactly in sequence, but the agent listed \"lump sum\" before \"installments\" for Bank A, which caused the match to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_38_0", "analysis": "The model used \"influencer collaborations\" instead of the required \"influencer partnerships\" for the Instagram strategy, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly represented the \"cuisine\" interest as \"cuisine\" instead of mapping it to the expected canonical form \"food\" in the function arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the required parameters for the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent used the preference \"comfortable cottage with breakfast\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast,\" failing to accurately reproduce the user's preference and thus not matching the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent scheduled the meeting with the agenda \"Complete and sign the contract\" instead of the required \"Finalize and sign the contract,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call included the \"frequency\" field in updatedToolSettings, but the expected call should only update the \"method\" field. This additional parameter caused a mismatch with the evaluator's expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields—specifically, \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and the \"duration\" field in \"coverage_options\"—from its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function argument schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to accurately represent the user's specified requirements in the function call; it generalized \"no less than a decade of industry expertise and outstanding communication abilities\" as \"industry experience\" and \"communication skills,\" omitting the explicit quantitative and qualitative criteria requested by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required function call format: it incorrectly nested \"travel_dates\" under \"user_preferences\" instead of at the top level, used non-canonical interest labels (\"cultural experiences\", \"unwinding\"), and mismatched destination_id casing and formatting. All these prevented evaluator matching."}

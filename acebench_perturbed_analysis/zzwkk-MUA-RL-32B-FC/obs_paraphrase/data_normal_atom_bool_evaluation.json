{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"include_legal_requirements\" in the function call, deviating from the tool's expected signature, resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_6", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra parameter \"warranty_check\": true to the FreeRepairInquiry_service function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extra argument \"include_trending_colors\" that is not supported by the ColorSchemeAdvisor_generatePalette tool schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_8", "analysis": "The agent used \"knee operation\" instead of \"knee surgery\" for the surgery_details parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call input and leading to the evaluator not recognizing it as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"work_focus\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus failure to properly fulfill the user's request for a schedule that includes professional responsibilities."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide required parameters (\"include_attachment\": true, \"encryption_level\": \"high\") in its function call to ConfidentialEmailService_sendEncrypted, resulting in an incomplete and unmatched function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the parameter \"provide_indoor_options\" in its function call, which was not expected or required for answering the user's question and does not match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"include_graphical_analysis\": true) in the function call to TaxPolicyImpactSimulator, making the call signature mismatched and causing it not to match the expected invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported parameters (\"pattern_detection\", \"include_visualization\", \"focus_on_physical_training\") in its function call that are not part of the tool's defined interface, resulting in no match with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_25", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"include_trending\": true parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"include_demographic_info\") in the function call, which does not match the required schema and caused the evaluator to reject the output as a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the boolean parameters include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, and include_device_usage to true, whereas the expected function call required all of these to be false. This parameter mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_37", "analysis": "The agent issued a function call with the general topic \"improving photovoltaic efficiency\" instead of specifying \"enhancing photovoltaic efficiency using nanomaterials\" as required. It failed to explicitly include nanomaterials in the research_topic parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the correct area_identifier \"Amazon rainforest\", failing to match the required function call parameters due to a formatting/naming discrepancy."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_45", "analysis": "The agent used \"young adults\" instead of the expected \"young adult demographic\" for the \"audience_data\" parameter, causing a mismatch with the required function call specification and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"has_high_chairs\" parameter in the function call, which is not supported by the VegetarianFamilyRestaurantSearch tool. This caused the function signature to mismatch and led to the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"include_indoor_suggestions\" parameter in the WeekendWeatherChecker function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the tool's expected input."}

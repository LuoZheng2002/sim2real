{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"votingContext\" key in the function call parameters, instead passing its fields at the top level. This resulted in a structural mismatch with the expected function call format, causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified explicit \"time_range\" values for each weekday instead of only listing the days as required by the function signature, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in an invalid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper in its parameters and also incorrectly shortened the sample IDs from \"Sample A\"/\"Sample B\" to \"A\"/\"B\", resulting in a mismatched function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON included an extra closing brace ('}}}') at the end, resulting in invalid JSON syntax that could not be parsed by the evaluator. This formatting error caused the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly broadened the function call's \"topics\" list and added a \"feedback_options\" parameter not present in the tool schema, rather than strictly updating only the requested fields (\"duration\" and emphasis on \"speech structure\") per the original tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"capacity\" parameter in the function call to GlobalCulturalEventPlanner, which does not accept it, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"participantData\": false field within the \"privacy\" object in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters for ConferenceSessionManager_createSession."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, which did not match the expected schema for mood_enhancing_playlist_generator, leading to function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the etiquette_meeting_manager tool when sufficient information was provided, instead asking for more details unnecessarily instead of proceeding with the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"gear\" information outside the \"hikingDetails\" object, instead of nesting it under \"hikingDetails.gear\" as required by the expected function call schema. This argument structure mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct function call but as a raw tool_call block instead of conforming to the required structured \"function_call\" format with \"name\" and \"parameters\" fields, causing the evaluator to not recognize the tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped each JSON tool call inside non-standard <tool_call> tags and added extra closing braces, resulting in malformed JSON that could not be parsed; it should have output strictly valid JSON for tool invocation without extraneous markup or syntax errors."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted an empty \"settings\": {} object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure. Both function calls must strictly match the expected parameters, including optional fields."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_36", "analysis": "The agent produced function calls with slightly incorrect argument values for the \"lightSource\" field (\"halogen lamp\", \"halogen light source\", \"UV light\") instead of the expected normalized values (\"halogen\", \"UV\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed the impact for direct employment, omitting the required function call for indirect employment. Both employment types should have been addressed separately, each with the detailed job role information provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a winePreferences argument in the function calls, which is not part of the pairing_cheeseWineMatcher tool's accepted parameters. Only cheese and its characteristics should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" parameter outside the \"customer\" object in the function call arguments, rather than nesting it within the \"customer\" as required by the function signature. This caused a mismatch with the expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter to the content_moderation_analysis function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call match according to the evaluator's expectations."}

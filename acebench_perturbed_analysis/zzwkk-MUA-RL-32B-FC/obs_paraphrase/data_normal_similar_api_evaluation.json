{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent called the incorrect function (baby_health_check_A) instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the correct tool that focuses on persistent vein visibility with associated concerning symptoms."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The model formatted the \"temperature_range\" argument as a string (\"18-25°C\") instead of the expected object with numeric min and max values (\"18 to 25\"), leading to a mismatch with the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"/\" instead of the required string \"slash\" for the notation_type parameter in the linguistic_phonemes function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the specific details for customer demographics and competitor analysis, and used non-matching parameter names and value formats, leading to a call that did not match the expected tool signature or values."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly modified the theme_keywords to include \"struggle for control\" instead of retaining \"urban exploration,\" and overly specified the conflict_element, leading to a function call that didn't match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_16", "analysis": "The agent output \"timeframe\": 12 without specifying the unit (weeks), while the expected call implies 12 weeks. Additionally, it used \"influencer collaborations\" instead of the required term \"influencer partnerships,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and failed function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_17", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize the user's diet description to the expected \"healthy\" value, instead passing \"general healthy choices\" as diet_preference. This caused a mismatch with the required parameters for the function call, leading to the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_b instead of the required task_schedule_a function, and its output format did not match the expected structure, resulting in a failure to fulfill the test case's function call requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The function call failed because the agent used paraphrased and semantically divergent values for \"investment_preferences,\" \"financial_status,\" and both goal descriptions instead of closely matching the expected input format required for correct tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected syntax_parsing_b instead of syntax_parsing_a, failing to match the tool choice in prior context. It ignored the established convention to use syntax_parsing_a regardless of the input language or UTF-8 character content."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"medium build\" for body_type instead of the required normalized value \"medium\" as specified in the expected parameters, resulting in a function call argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_26", "analysis": "The agent listed \"science\" before \"technology\" in the topics_of_interest array, whereas the expected output had \"technology\" before \"science\". This order mismatch led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the \"include_statistics\" parameter to the eco_vision_B function call, which is not supported by the tool's specification, resulting in a function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra parameter \"activity_level\" to the health_tips_a function call, which only expects \"preferences\" and \"age\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent generated a function call with an insufficiently detailed \"problem_description\" argument, missing the context about checked updates and system restart, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual parameters for clarity_guide_b."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, despite the latter being the appropriate tool available for further analysis as per the expected function call. This shows a persistent tool selection error."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, which did not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a mismatch in parameter formatting: it used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" for the relation and paraphrased the status rather than matching the expected phrase, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called Love_Importance_B instead of the required Love_Importance_A, failing to align aspects (\"individual\" and \"societal\") and language level (\"advanced\") with the question's specific requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent used a paraphrased value (\"relatively new and not widely recognized in the mainstream market\") for the \"current_brand_status\" parameter instead of the required canonical value (\"not well-known\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent generated a function call with a title that was more detailed and did not exactly match the expected \"AI applications in oncology,\" leading to a mismatch with the evaluator’s strict parameter matching requirement."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer call, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected tool input and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"safety_checks\" field under \"locking_mechanism\" in its function call, thus failing to match the required schema for adjust_seat_safety, which only accepts \"status\" for locking_mechanism."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"printTime\" in the function arguments, causing its function call to not match the expected schema and resulting in a failure to invoke the tool correctly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary \"details\" about protocol steps in the DeviceConnection_authenticateBluetooth function's arguments, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch and failure to correctly call the function as specified by the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent output \"pop\" in lowercase for the genre parameter, while the expected function call required \"Pop\" with an uppercase \"P\"; the parameter value did not match the expected case-sensitive format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a trailing period in the \"content\" argument, causing a mismatch with the expected function call, which did not include the period. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"eventTypes\" argument not specified in the available tool's schema, resulting in a function call signature mismatch and failure to invoke the correct tool. Only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" were expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unexpected \"features\" field (as an empty list) in the \"simulation_parameters\" argument, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected schema and thus caused a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" parameter in the correctionPreferences object, which was not part of the expected function signature. This extraneous parameter caused the function calls to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but omitted leading zeros in the year field (\"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\"), causing its calls not to match the expected parameters. This formatting error in the date string led to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_39", "analysis": "The agent only made a single function call for the first date range and failed to issue a second function call for the July 10-12 period, thus not checking both requested time periods as the task required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"dataOptions\" parameter with subfields (\"includeHumidity\" and \"updateFrequency\") to the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature, which only required location and time parameters."}

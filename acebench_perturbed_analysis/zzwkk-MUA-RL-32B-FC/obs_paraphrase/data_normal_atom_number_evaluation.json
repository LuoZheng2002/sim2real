{"id": "normal_atom_number_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"historical landmarks\" instead of the required parameter value \"historical sites\" for the interest field, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call and failure to meet the strict parameter requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_5", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported parameter \"connectionType\" to the SmartHomeDeviceIntegration function call. The tool only accepts \"deviceID\", and the extra argument caused a mismatch, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported extra parameter (\"analysisDepth\": 5) in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected schema and resulting in evaluator failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed ageGroup as 25 (a single age) instead of 20 (the specified lower bound of the target age range), failing to match the expected parameter for ageGroup. The function call argument did not strictly align with the benchmark's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"radius\" parameter in the FindNearbyMedicineDisposal function call, which does not match the function's expected signature and led to the evaluator failing to recognize the call. Only latitude and longitude should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unsupported parameters (\"databaseVersion\" and \"similarityScore\") to the ContentSimilarityAnalyzer function call, which only accepts \"novelContent.\" This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the call as not matching the tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent only included the industrialOutput parameter in its function call, omitting serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment, despite all being necessary to fully address the user's economic development analysis request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent set the receptionDelay parameter to 10 instead of reflecting a plausible message delay (such as the expected 1200), indicating it failed to extract or infer the reported or typical delay from the user's complaint."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, deviating from the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call as a mismatch."}

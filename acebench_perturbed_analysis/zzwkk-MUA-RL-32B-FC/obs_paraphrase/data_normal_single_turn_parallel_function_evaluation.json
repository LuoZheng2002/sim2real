{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent failed to distinguish between similarly-typed components in the second circuit, generically labeling both as \"resistor\" in both the components and connections, rather than correctly identifying them (e.g., \"resistor1\", \"resistor2\") as required for unambiguous mapping in the function call."}

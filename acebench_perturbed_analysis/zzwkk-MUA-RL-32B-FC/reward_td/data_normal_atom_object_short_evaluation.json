{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the \"context\" argument when calling poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, causing a schema mismatch and preventing successful function invocation. Only \"culture\" was expected in the context."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added an extra parameter (\"safety_checks\") to the locking_mechanism object in the function call, deviating from the expected function signature and causing no exact match for the adjust_seat_safety function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"printTime\" parameter and nested parameter values, resulting in a parameter structure that did not match the expected function signature, which only required the specified settings without additional or unnecessary fields."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The model omitted proper capitalization for the \"genre\" value (\"pop\" instead of \"Pop\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call signature. This prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter in the checkParameters object for the ContentAuthenticator_verifyOriginality function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected signature for CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline and thus failed to make a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file (\"recording_light.mp3\" with light intensity) instead of handling all three recordings with their specified correction intensities, failing to fulfill the complete multi-step request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the year \"100 AD\" as \"100\" instead of the required four-digit format \"0100\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call match for that instance."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent made only one function call without specifying any patient ID or date range, instead of making individual hospital_record_fetch calls with the required parameters for each patient as expected. It failed to decompose the multi-patient request properly."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent's function call matches argument structure but failed because it outputted the full call as a <tool_call> XML-like block, rather than in the expected structured function-call API format; this caused evaluator parsing to fail to recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_5", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect artwork_id (\"waterfall_1961\" instead of \"Waterfall\") in the function call, causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid or matching request. The expected artwork_id was case-sensitive and did not include the year."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"time_frame\" values as full ISO datetime strings with hours/minutes/seconds, rather than the required \"YYYY-MM-DD\" date-only format expected by the member_engagement_tracker function. This mismatch prevented a successful function call match."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent provided the data source's \"sourceId\" as \"techdataapi\" (a string) instead of the expected numeric ID \"1\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The model included a \"Z\" timezone designator in the timeRange values (\"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z\"), while the expected format omitted it (\"2024-01-15T00:00:00\"), causing the evaluator not to match the function call despite correct argument content."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function but generated incorrect parameters: the campaign title, age range max, and campaign year did not match the expected values, indicating a failure to accurately extract and map key details from the user request."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in the AccountManager_verifyDocument function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus failure to match the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required parameters: it failed to include the \"historical\" field in traffic_data and did not provide unique \"source_id\" values for each traffic source, resulting in a schema mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The agent used the restaurant_id \"luigis_italian_restaurant\" instead of the expected \"Luigi's Italian Restaurant\", failing to match the required format for the function call parameter and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent formatted the tool call arguments correctly but used a placeholder string (\"Provided base64 encoded string\") instead of the actual base64 string provided by the user, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Free Play\" activity in the routineDetails argument, failing to include all user-specified requirements from the prompt. This led to a function call that did not match the expected routine structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used \"Green Tea\" instead of \"green tea\" for the teaName parameter, causing a case-sensitive mismatch with the expected function call arguments. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile parameters, which is not supported by the tool's function signature, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to call the expected function."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent improperly wrapped the tool call JSON inside XML-like <tool_call> tags and included an extra closing curly brace, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. The output must be strictly valid JSON and avoid extraneous markup or characters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent nested \"vibration_patterns\" inside \"app_details\" instead of placing it at the top level within the \"parameters\" object, resulting in a mismatched function call structure that the evaluator could not recognize as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function name and parameters, but used \"end\": \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the expected \"end\": \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter check."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra \"timeFrame\" parameter that is not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a function call mismatch. It should have used only the required \"threadID\" and \"messages\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"process_info\" field with an empty list in the \"details\" argument, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format and leading the evaluator to mark the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the \"siteId\" parameter (\"Great Wall - Beijing Segment\" instead of the required \"Great Wall Beijing\"), resulting in a function call that did not match any available tool signature."}

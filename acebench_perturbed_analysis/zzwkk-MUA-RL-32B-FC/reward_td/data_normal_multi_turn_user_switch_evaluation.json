{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter required by the function signature, resulting in the function call not matching the expected format and therefore failing to execute correctly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" argument (with \"keyLength\": 256) in the function call, which does not match the expected parameters for DataGuard_encryptBusinessData, causing the evaluator to reject the call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" as the museumId parameter in the function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect analysisPeriod value (\"2023-11\" instead of the expected \"2023-12\") in its SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions function call, leading to a mismatch with the required function parameters for the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported parameters (\"translationFeatures\": with idiomaticExpressions, culturalInsights, pronunciationAdjustments) in the function call, which do not match the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter value (\"Paris, France\"), whereas the ground truth expects just \"Paris\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"analysisDepth\" parameter to \"detailed\" instead of the required \"basic,\" causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in the function call not matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in the function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a non-matching function call despite otherwise correct function selection and argument structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the function call, which caused the call to not exactly match the expected function signature, resulting in evaluation failure. The agent should have omitted \"analysisDepth\"."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Tokyo, Japan\" instead of just \"Tokyo\" for the \"destination\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameter value and resulting in a failed match by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature despite correctly including other enhancement settings and image URLs."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent output the function call with parameters that semantically match the expected input, but it used the key \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" in the function call, causing the evaluator to not recognize a match. This is a schema formatting error, not a reasoning mistake."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call because it used \"Finance Department\" (capitalized) as the targetGroup parameter instead of the required lowercase \"finance department,\" leading to a mismatch in evaluator comparison."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call arguments, which was not expected by the tool schema, resulting in the function call not matching the required format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call within custom XML-like <tool_call> tags instead of plain JSON as required, causing a parsing failure even though the function arguments themselves were correct. The error is due to invalid output formatting, not function logic."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"#008000\" (a dark green) instead of \"#00FF00\" (a bright green) for the primary color, failing to match the user's request for a green logo; the color specification did not align with the expected exact value."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an incorrect \"influence\" parameter in its function call, which does not match the expected parameters schema for cultural_event_classical_music_impact, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected call."}

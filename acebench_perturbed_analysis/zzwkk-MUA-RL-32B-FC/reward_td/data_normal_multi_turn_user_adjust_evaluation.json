{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent called DecisionData_retrieveDetails instead of submitting the review as instructed; it failed to use the required DecisionAudit_submitReview function to record the user's comments and approval status, directly ignoring the user's clear response."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and parameters but incorrectly set the year in the date range to 2023 instead of 2024, failing to align with the actual and expected timeline for the query."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent issued two tool calls instead of one, causing a JSON parsing error due to trailing characters. Only the ProjectManagement_assignTeamMembers call was needed; the extra ProjectManagement_assignTeamMembers_Fast call led to output format failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels,\" causing the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" in its manage_feedback_collection call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in a failure to match the required parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added \"to\" to the reviewReason (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in failure to match the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent listed the repayment options for Bank A's debt in the wrong order (\"lump sum\" before \"installments\"), causing the function call to not match the expected structure which required \"installments\" first, \"lump sum\" second."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_Fast) and omitted required parameters (employeeId and feedbackId); it should have used PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback with proper arguments as per the user's request and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"insuranceOptions\" inside the top-level arguments instead of nesting it within \"rentalOptions,\" resulting in a function call parameter structure that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"endDate\" instead of the required \"checkOutDate\" key in the \"stayDuration\" parameter for the hotel reservation function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the setupUserRoles function instead of securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, thus failing to specify permissions and enable auditing as required for configuring access controls according to the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Rome\" in the \"location\" parameter as \"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of just \"Trastevere,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call structure. The function signature requires only the neighborhood, not the city."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant_name (\"Trattoria near Colosseum\") instead of the expected, more generic \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" and treated \"near Colosseum\" as part of the name rather than as the location, leading to a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Team\" prefix in \"teamName\" fields, returning \"Alpha\" and \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Alpha\" and \"Team Beta,\" resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called only the validation tool instead of invoking TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate to actually compute the requested innovation rates, thus failing to perform the core calculation task specified by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"with breakfast included\" in the \"preferences\" parameter, differing from the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast.\" This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, failing to directly compare the two leaders as requested by the user prompt and specified in the available toolset."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (schedule_meeting) with appropriate parameters, but likely failed to match the expected output due to capitalization differences in the \"agenda\" field (\"finalize\" vs \"Finalize\"), resulting in a strict evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance_cost value ($115.25) instead of the correct total ($120.5 per person x 2 = $241 or if expecting per-person $120.5), and did not match the expected argument for insurance_cost ($120.5), causing a parameter mismatch in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's stated budget of $1000–$2000 and instead used a much lower budget ($100–$200) in the book_accommodation function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unchanged settings for \"impactAnalysisModule\" in the function call, instead of only updating the \"communicationModule\" as requested. The function call should have contained only the modified \"communicationModule\" field."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call: \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and \"duration\" in \"coverage_options\". This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"desired_qualities\" field as [\"10+ years industry experience\", \"excellent communication skills\"] instead of using the expected [\"10 years of industry experience\", \"excellent communication skills\"], resulting in a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" outside of \"user_preferences\" in the function call arguments structure, causing a schema mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as matching."}

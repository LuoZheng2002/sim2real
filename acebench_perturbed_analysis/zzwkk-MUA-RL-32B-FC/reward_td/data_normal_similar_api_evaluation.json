{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the correct tool specializing in persistent vein visibility with concerning symptoms. It also did not fully capture or leverage the behavioral context as specified in the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function name and parameters, but the value for \"temperature_range\" was \"18-25\" instead of the expected \"18 to 25,\" leading to a mismatch during function call comparison. The agent failed to preserve the required string format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent’s function call did not match the expected schema: key names, value formats, and some values for fields like customer demographics, business goals, and evaluation criteria differed from the expected output, leading to a mismatch with the required function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent issued the correct function call name and appropriate arguments, but the evaluator failed to detect the match due to a minor difference in the \"conflict_element\" value (\"struggle for control between AI systems and human authorities\" vs. \"AI control\"), revealing argument mismatch rather than function call absence."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the task_schedule_b function instead of the required task_schedule_a function, and included all tasks rather than only scheduling the newly added \"Prepare Presentation\" task as requested in the user's follow-up."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The model failed to match the expected function call because it altered the parameter values (\"technology, renewable energy\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy\") and paraphrased other fields, causing a mismatch with the strict evaluator's requirements for precise string matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the \"syntax_parsing_b\" function instead of the required \"syntax_parsing_a\" function, failing to maintain consistency with the tool used previously for syntax checking and not following the expected function call pattern."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"body_type\": \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\", causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in no function call match for style_recommendation_a. This deviation in parameter value formatting led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent returned the function call with parameters embedded within the \"name\" string instead of using a proper \"arguments\" or \"parameters\" field, resulting in the missing structured arguments required for correct tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent provided an incomplete and insufficiently detailed problem_description argument to the clarity_guide_b function, failing to include essential troubleshooting steps and context as expected, which prevented matching to the ground truth function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the analyze_social_data_a function instead of the required analyze_social_data_b function, failing to satisfy the explicit tool requirement for this follow-up analysis. The function call did not match the expected tool."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used the relation label \"coworker\" instead of the required \"co-worker\" and added extra detail (\"causing tension\") not present in the expected status. This mismatch in argument values caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent provided extra, unnecessarily detailed information in the \"current_brand_status\" parameter (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") instead of matching the expected concise value (\"not well-known\"), resulting in a mismatched function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent correctly used the med_aiArticleGen tool with appropriate parameters, but failed due to a case-mismatch between \"AI Applications in Oncology\" (model output) and \"AI applications in oncology\" (expected), leading to an exact string comparison failure."}

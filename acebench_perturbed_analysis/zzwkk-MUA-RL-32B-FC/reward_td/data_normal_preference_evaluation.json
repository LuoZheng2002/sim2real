{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for the new password and security question/answer, failing to extract and apply the correct parameters from the user profile or context as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to call any tool or function to update the user profile, instead replying conversationally and asking for clarification, despite the question containing enough information to proceed with the update using the correct tool."}
{"id": "normal_preference_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of directly invoking calculateShippingCost with the provided package dimensions, shipping method, home location, and membership status, thereby failing to answer the user's shipping cost calculation request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the correct category \"Sports Goods\" in the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing an exact parameter mismatch that led to no matching function call being found."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent included incorrect and extraneous parameters (\"userPreferredLoginTime\":\"CST\",\"loginFrequency\":\"Weekly\",\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and used the wrong password value, failing to match the expected function call signature and parameter values for loginUser."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect email address (\"jessica_newemail@example.com\") instead of using the user's existing address (\"jessica.l@example.com\") for the profile update, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The model incorrectly used \"Books, Wellness\" for UserPreferredCategories instead of only \"Wellness\" as expected, leading to a function call mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter value requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of \"Bronze\" as required by the user’s actual membership status, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call and failure to accurately utilize the user’s membership benefits."}
{"id": "normal_preference_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called fetchUserPreferences instead of calculateShippingCost. It failed to directly address the user’s request to calculate the express shipping cost for the specified large package and member status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to use any tool/function call to update the user's profile and instead requested more information, ignoring that sufficient details (new email and city) were implicitly provided or expected from context. No function was called as required."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The model incorrectly capitalized \"Mexican Meal\" instead of \"Mexican meal\" for the \"OrderName\" parameter, causing the function call not to match the expected schema and resulting in the evaluator failing to recognize it."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required \"updateUserProfile\" tool and instead responded conversationally, asking for user input, despite being provided with all necessary parameters in the test context. No function call tags were produced, resulting in no action taken."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent called the correct processPayment function with the right parameters, but it capitalized \"OrderName\" as \"Dinner Order\" instead of the required \"dinner order\", causing a parameter value mismatch with the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to perform string normalization and used \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of the expected \"small burger place by the elm park\" as the RestaurantName, resulting in a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" alongside \"Gluten-Free\" in UserDietaryPreference, rather than just \"Gluten-Free\" as expected. This mismatch prevented a function call match despite correct function and structure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model incorrectly capitalized the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), causing an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function call, despite otherwise correct tool and parameter usage."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for \"RestaurantName\" (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as \"Vegan\" instead of leaving it null, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. All other values were correct, but the incorrect OrderName caused the function call to not match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserDietaryPreferences\" and \"UserMembershipStatus\" parameters in its submitReview function call, failing to include all necessary information as requested by the user and expected by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\") and failed to pass the user's dietary preference (\"Spicy\"), instead supplying \"None.\" As a result, the function call parameters did not match expectations."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required Amount parameter and incorrectly set UserRefundPreference to \"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit,\" failing to construct a function call matching the expected signature and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserDietaryPreference parameter to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align with the user's request and the menu item's description. This parameter mismatch led to no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the updateUserProfile function; instead, it responded conversationally and asked for clarification, even though all required information to make the function call was present in the context."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included both \"Vegetarian\" and \"Gluten-Free\" in the UserDietaryPreference field instead of only \"Vegetarian\" as required by the expected output. This caused a mismatch in the function arguments."}

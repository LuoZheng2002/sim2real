{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary and incorrect \"time_range\" fields to the \"time_restrictions\" parameter instead of specifying only the weekdays as required; it failed to match the expected function call format by introducing extra structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper in the function parameters and stripped the \"Sample\" prefix from the sample IDs, leading to a function call that did not match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to precisely specify the \"availability\" parameter for the fireworks safety app, outputting \"all platforms\" instead of the required explicit value \"iOS, Android, Web,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"session_length\" parameter in its function call, which is not part of the expected function signature. This caused a mismatch with the available tool and resulted in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent slightly altered the meeting topic (\"New Product Launch Discussion\" instead of \"Launch of our new product\") from the user input, leading to a non-matching function call according to the evaluator's strict expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"gear\" information incorrectly at the top level instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails\", resulting in a function call that does not match the required parameter structure for outdoorAdventurePlanner_createHikingPlan."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped its JSON tool calls in extraneous XML-style <tool_call> tags, resulting in an invalid, unparsable format instead of outputting each function call as a clean JSON object as required by the API."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object in the second widget for the summary from S&P500, causing its function call arguments to not exactly match the expected schema and resulting in a mismatch with the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, omitting the required separate analysis for indirect employment. It failed to make two function calls (one for direct, one for indirect) as requested in the original question and shown in the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent included \"location\" and \"time\" as nested fields inside the \"customer\" object, instead of keeping \"time\" as a top-level parameter. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call signature and led to evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an extra parameter \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" that is not supported by the function signature, causing the function call to not match the expected format and resulting in evaluation failure."}

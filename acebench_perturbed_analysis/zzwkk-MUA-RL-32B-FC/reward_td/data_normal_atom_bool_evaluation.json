{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent included an extra argument (\"include_legal_requirements\") in its function call that was not expected, causing a mismatch with the required parameters for the ExportRegulationAdvisor tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter \"include_trending_colors\" in the function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected signature and thus failure to produce a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to make any function/tool call, responding only in natural language with options and clarifying questions, instead of directly invoking the appropriate email-sending function as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"provide_indoor_options\" parameter, which was not expected or required for the HikingWeatherAdvisor tool call. The parameters did not exactly match the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included the \"include_graphical_analysis\" argument in the TaxPolicyImpactSimulator function call, which is not supported by the tool's defined parameters, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the explicit phrase \"document with\" in the \"training_routine_data\" parameter value, instead paraphrasing it. This mismatch prevented the function call from exactly matching the expected parameters as required by the evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter (\"include_demographic_info\") in its function call to AudienceSegmentationTool, causing the call to not match the expected signature and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument include_weekend_rules to the DailyTrafficRuleNotifier function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call being recognized by the evaluator. Only area_code was expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the analysis inclusion flags (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true, whereas the expected call required all these flags to be false. The root cause is misinterpreting or overlooking default or required parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent included extra unsupported parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") in the function call, which do not match the defined signature of OceanicBiodiversityData_fetch, resulting in a mismatch with expected valid calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the required \"Amazon rainforest\" for the area_identifier parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in failure to meet the strict parameter formatting requirement."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_45", "analysis": "The agent used \"young adults\" as the audience_data instead of the expected \"young adult demographic,\" causing a mismatch with the strict parameter value required by the evaluator. This led to a failure in recognizing the function call despite correct tool use otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the \"industry\" parameter value as \"Technology\" instead of the required lowercase \"technology,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}

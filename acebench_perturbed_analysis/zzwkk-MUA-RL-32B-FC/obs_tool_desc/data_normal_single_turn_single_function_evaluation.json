{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The function call failed to match the expected format due to capitalization differences in the beneficiary names and relationships (e.g., \"User\" vs. \"user,\" \"Grandchild\" vs. \"grandchild\"), leading to evaluator mismatch despite the semantic correctness of the call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"start\" and \"end\" values in the \"time_frame\" argument as full ISO timestamps with time and timezone instead of date strings (\"YYYY-MM-DD\") as required by the function specification, leading to a mismatch in the function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used \"techdataapi\" as the sourceId instead of the required \"1\", resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to generate the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The model's function call used date-time strings with 'Z' for time zone, while the expected parameters omit the 'Z' and the seconds. This formatting mismatch led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for related tasks instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters into a single WebSecurity_EncryptionManager call as required by the function's expected usage."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect start/end years (2024 instead of 2023), set an ageRange max of 30 instead of the expected 35, and did not use the required campaign title, resulting in failure to match the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"commonName\" as \"Blue and white bird with long beak\" rather than the generic term \"bird,\" resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required parameters \"historical\" and \"source_id\" for each traffic source in \"traffic_data\", resulting in an invalid argument structure that did not conform to the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The agent used the restaurant's internal ID (\"luigis_italian_restaurant\") instead of the required display name (\"Luigi's Italian Restaurant\") for the restaurant_id parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent correctly called the intended function with proper arguments, but its tool/function call format did not match the strict expected schema (e.g., \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\"), leading to a mismatch despite an otherwise correct action."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the requested \"Free Play\" activity from the routineDetails, failing to fully include all user-specified components in the morning routine."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_54", "analysis": "The agent's function arguments used \"Software\" (capital S) for the industry instead of the expected lowercase \"software\", causing a mismatch with the expected call parameters and resulting in failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used \"Green Tea\" with capitalization in the \"teaName\" parameter instead of the required lowercase \"green tea,\" resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format. This caused the evaluator to fail matching the outputs."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_59", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call JSON with extra closing brackets, leading to invalid JSON (\"trailing characters\"), which prevented parsing. The root cause is incorrect serialization or formatting of the tool call structure, not the function selection or parameter content."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile object, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected parameters for BookRecommendationEngine_fetchRecommendations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON by including an extra closing brace, and wrapped the tool call in non-standard <tool_call> tags instead of returning a plain JSON object, causing the tool call to be unparsable."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"vibration_patterns\" at the top level of the arguments instead of nesting it within \"app_details\" as required by the HapticFeedbackIntegration function schema, resulting in a function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent set the \"end\" time in the \"timeWindow\" parameter to \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the required \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call in an invalid format by wrapping valid JSON in extraneous XML-like tags (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\"), resulting in a JSON parsing failure. The tool call should have been output as plain JSON without any additional markup."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_84", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"fontWeight\" parameter in the function call, which did not match the expected tool signature that only requires \"fontFamily\". This caused the function call to be unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"process_info\" field within the \"details\" parameter, causing the function call's arguments to deviate from the required schema and resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_88", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON by including an unclosed object (missing a closing brace), causing parsing failure. Additionally, it incorrectly nested \"time_of_year\" within \"dish_details\" instead of as a top-level argument, misaligning with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the siteId parameter (\"Great Wall - Beijing Segment\" instead of \"Great Wall Beijing\"), so its function call did not match the expected input, leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}

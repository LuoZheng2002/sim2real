{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent failed to nest the input data under the required \"votingContext\" parameter in the function call. Instead, it supplied the arguments at the top level, leading to a schema mismatch with the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper in the parameters and used sample IDs (\"A\", \"B\") instead of the full names (\"Sample A\", \"Sample B\"), causing the function call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"feedback_options\" parameter to the publicSpeaking_coach function call, instead of only supplying the expected \"session_details\" parameter, resulting in a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"all platforms\" for the fireworks app's availability instead of listing the specific platforms (\"iOS, Android, Web\") as required, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"capacity\" field in the function arguments, which is not part of the expected schema for GlobalCulturalEventPlanner, causing the function call to not match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, which caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulted in no valid matching function call being recognized by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"gear\" information at the top level of the function call instead of nesting it inside \"hikingDetails\" per the expected function signature, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The model used the correct tool and provided all necessary information, but mismatched the function schema by using an \"arguments\" wrapper instead of the required \"parameters\" wrapper for function input, leading to no recognized function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent failed to issue the required tool call by not formatting its response with the necessary <tool_call> tag, instead responding in natural language and requesting additional information that was not explicitly required by the prompt."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent failed because it wrapped the JSON tool call outputs inside extraneous <tool_call> tags, resulting in invalid, unparsable JSON. This formatting error prevented correct tool invocation despite otherwise correct function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters where \"settings\": {} was required, but not included in the actual output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a second function call for indirect employment as explicitly requested, so it did not cover both direct and indirect impacts as required by the user prompt."}

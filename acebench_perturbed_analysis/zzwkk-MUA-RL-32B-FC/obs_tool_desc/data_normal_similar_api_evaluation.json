{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to select the function that specifically addresses ongoing vein prominence and related symptoms, as required by the user's concern and the tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_7", "analysis": "The agent provided an invalid value \"/\" for the \"notation_type\" parameter instead of the expected \"slash\", indicating it misunderstood the required argument format for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent generated function call arguments that did not sufficiently match the expected schema—specifically, differences in key names and values (e.g., incorrect demographic details, inconsistent evaluation_criteria fields), leading to a mismatch with the required function call format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent over-specified the function arguments by introducing an extra theme keyword (\"AI control\") and an overly detailed conflict element, instead of using only the provided keywords and the concise \"AI control\" as the conflict element as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked task_schedule_b instead of the required task_schedule_a, using the wrong API for this scenario. This led to a function call mismatch and failure to produce the expected scheduling using task_schedule_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required function call because it deviated in parameter wording (e.g., added \"sectors\" and rephrased status/goals); stricter adherence to expected parameter values and phrasing was needed for an exact function call match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called syntax_parsing_b instead of syntax_parsing_a, failing to match the function required by the task. It did not select the expected tool despite syntax_parsing_a being appropriate for the input sentence."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"body_type\" as \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\", causing a parameter mismatch that led to the function call not matching the required format. All other information was correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"activity_level\" parameter in its call to health_tips_a, causing a schema mismatch and preventing proper matching with the expected function call, which only allowed \"preferences\" and \"age\" as parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call argument was too brief and did not incorporate detailed problem context or the explicit request for diverse perspectives as required. It failed to rephrase and expand the problem description to reflect the user's need for overlooked areas."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, failing to use the correct function provided for detecting user purchasing behaviors as required by the test case and toolset."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter, \"touch_navigation\", in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, which does not match the function's expected schema—causing the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked the poetry_analysis_b function instead of the required poetry_analysis_a, failing to match the expected tool name despite both tools having similar descriptions and purposes. This indicates confusion or disregard for the specific function requested."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The model made unnecessary changes to the field names and details—it output \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker,\" added extra wording to the status, and didn’t match arguments exactly as expected, causing a mismatch with the evaluator’s strict format checking."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a \"theme\" argument instead of matching the required \"importance of love\" value, leading to a parameter mismatch. The tool call's argument structure did not exactly match the expected function signature despite selecting the right tool."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent passed an over-detailed and paraphrased \"current_brand_status\" argument (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") instead of exactly the required \"not well-known\", causing a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"AI Applications in Oncology\" (capitalized) for the title instead of the exact casing \"AI applications in oncology\" expected by the evaluator, causing a strict matching failure."}

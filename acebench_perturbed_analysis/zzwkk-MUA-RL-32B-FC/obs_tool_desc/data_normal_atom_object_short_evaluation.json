{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter in the function call to poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature, which only allowed \"text\" and \"context\" (with \"culture\")."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"safety_checks\" field within the locking_mechanism argument that is not part of the adjust_seat_safety function schema, resulting in a function call mismatch and failure to execute the expected action."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"printTime\" parameter not present in the expected function schema, causing its function call to not match the allowable input format for \"artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer.\" This extraneous field broke compliance with the tool's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous \"details\" in the \"protocol\" argument that are not part of the expected function schema, resulting in a function call signature mismatch and failure to invoke the function as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent outputted the genre as \"pop\" (lowercase), while the expected function call required \"Pop\" (capitalized), resulting in a strict matching failure due to case sensitivity in the genre parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter to the \"checkParameters\" object, deviating from the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"eventTypes\" argument to the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, which was not specified in the expected parameters, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra empty \"features\" array in the \"simulation_parameters\", causing its function call structure to not exactly match the expected parameters, leading to a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file instead of all three and added an extra unsupported parameter (\"feedbackMode\": \"textual\"), failing to call the function separately for each recording and intensity level as required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent formatted the specificDate for the Colosseum as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required \"0100-08-01\" (four-digit year), causing the function call not to match the expected parameters. This date formatting mismatch is the root cause of failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for tasks that should be combined into a single call with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters together, as the function supports handling both actions simultaneously."}

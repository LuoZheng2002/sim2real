{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter, \"analysisDepth\", in the function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature that accepts only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed \"ageGroup\": 25 instead of the expected lower bound (\"ageGroup\": 20) for the 20-30 age range, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and failure to match the test case."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"riskAppetite\" parameter to the TechStockInsightGenerator function call instead of only including the required \"industry\", \"daysToAnalyze\", and \"predictionDays\" fields as specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported similarityScore parameter to the ContentSimilarityAnalyzer function call, which only requires the novelContent argument according to the tool's definition. This caused the function call to not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted required parameters \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment,\" providing only \"industrialOutput.\" This incomplete argument set led to the function call mismatch and failure to retrieve the full requested economic comparison."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent used an implausibly short receptionDelay value (10) instead of correctly using the likely intended or user-reported delay (should be 1200), resulting in an incorrect function call that didn't match the expected parameters for diagnosing the message reception issue."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, which does not accept this argument. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature, resulting in failure to match the evaluator's criteria."}

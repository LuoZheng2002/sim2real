{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used 2023 as the year in its dateRange instead of the correct 2024, resulting in a mismatched function call that does not correspond to the user's intended travel dates."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent's output included superfluous trailing characters (extra line break and closing brace) after the required JSON object, breaking JSON parsing. The root cause is improper formatting of the tool call output, violating the function-calling protocol's strict JSON requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected (\"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\"), resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to match the benchmark's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"feedbackId\": \"most-recent\" parameter in its function call, resulting in an incomplete and non-matching invocation of the PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback tool."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent included the extra word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" argument, making it \"to ensure compliance\" instead of the correct \"ensure compliance,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of the required securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, failing to specify role-based permissions and audit settings as asked, thus not fulfilling the user's request for configuring access control."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra top-level parameter \"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\" and added \"form_title\" to the feedback_form, neither of which are present in the expected schema. This resulted in a parameter mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The model's function call listed the repayment options for \"installments\" and \"lump sum\" in the wrong order compared to the expected output, causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a matching call despite the data being otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent placed \"insuranceOptions\" inside the top-level parameters instead of nesting it within \"rentalOptions\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch and evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Rome\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Trastevere, Rome\") instead of using just \"Trastevere\" as required by the function schema, leading to a mismatch and failure to trigger the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly hallucinated a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\") and set \"Rome\" as the location, instead of reserving at a \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" near the Colosseum as requested. This mismatch caused the function call to not match expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the full team names (\"Alpha\" instead of \"Team Alpha\", \"Beta\" instead of \"Team Beta\") in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameter values and subsequent failure to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the ValidateLeaderInput_checkLeaderType function instead of TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate, failing to calculate innovation rates as requested. It focused on validating leader types rather than performing the required innovation metrics analysis for transformational leader teams."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included an extra \"activityLevel\" key within the \"touristPreferences\" argument, which was not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch with the required parameter structure for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The root cause of the failure is that the model's function call specified \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" in the preferences argument, while the expected output required \"cozy cottage with breakfast\" (i.e., without the word \"included\"), leading to a strict mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of leadership_compare_two_leaders, failing to use the specific comparison function required for contrasting the visionary strength of the two leaders as prompted."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The failure occurred because the model's function call arguments for the \"agenda\" field did not match case sensitivity (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs. \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" setting for the communicationModule in the modifyDeployment call, instead of only updating the \"method\" as the user requested, leading to a mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used an insurance cost of $110 instead of $120.5 from the relevant insurance option provided earlier, leading to a mismatch in the expected function call parameters for calculating the travel budget."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"existing_conditions\" field in each traveler's details and omitted the \"duration\" field in coverage_options, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter with the \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\" settings in its function call, omitting key inputs needed for demand-driven, forecast-based deal aggregation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The model altered the \"desired_qualities\" parameter from \"10 years of industry experience\" (expected) to \"10+ years industry experience\" (actual), causing a mismatch in string values and failing to match the evaluator's expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call: it placed \"travel_dates\" outside of \"user_preferences\" and used uppercase destination IDs instead of proper case and key format, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters and preventing successful call matching."}

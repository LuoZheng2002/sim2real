{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unsupported parameter \"include_legal_requirements\" in the ExportRegulationAdvisor function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the function's expected signature. Only \"export_category\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_6", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported arguments (\"warranty_check\" and \"include_support_contact\") in its function call to FreeRepairInquiry_service instead of restricting parameters to only \"customer_id\" and \"purchase_receipt\" as required by the tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_7", "analysis": "The agent included an extraneous argument \"include_trending_colors\": false in the function call, which does not match the expected parameters; the function only accepts \"style_description\" and \"room_function\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"work_focus\" parameter in the function call, omitting a key argument needed for the expected comprehensive schedule that balances work and leisure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"include_attachment\": true, \"encryption_level\": \"high\") in its function call, defaulting to unspecified values instead of inferring or asking for the expected high security and attachment in the encrypted email."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra, unsupported argument \"provide_indoor_options\" in the function call instead of only passing the required \"hiking_location\" parameter as specified in the API, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"include_graphical_analysis\" parameter, which was not expected or required. This caused a mismatch with the exact expected function signature, leading to the evaluator rejecting the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"pattern_detection\", \"include_visualization\", \"focus_on_physical_training\") to the EliteTennisTrainingPatterns function call instead of only passing the required \"training_routine_data\" parameter as expected by the tool, resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"include_demographic_info\": true in the AudienceSegmentationTool call, which was not part of the expected or defined parameters, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the correct function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"include_weekend_rules\": true) in the function call to DailyTrafficRuleNotifier, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature that requires only the \"area_code\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"consider_temperature\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected schema that only requires the \"city\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch and failure to call the function properly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the analysis flags (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true, when the expected function call required all these parameters to be false."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") in the function call to OceanicBiodiversityData_fetch, instead of matching the expected call structure with only the required \"zone_identifier\" argument."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Amazon_rainforest\" instead of the expected \"Amazon rainforest\" for the area_identifier parameter, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_44", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the FinanceLectureBookingAssistant tool as required, instead only replying with clarifying questions and omitting the necessary tool-use annotation to initiate the booking process."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required parameter \"include_indoor_suggestions\" (defaulting to false). As a result, the call didn't match the expected format, leading to the failure. The agent needed to include all required parameters in its call."}

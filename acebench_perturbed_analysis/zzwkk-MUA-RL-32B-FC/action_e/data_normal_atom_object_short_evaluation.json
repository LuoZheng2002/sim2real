{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"emotion_depth\" in the \"context\" argument for poetry_theme_emotion_analyzer, leading to a parameter mismatch instead of following the expected schema with only \"culture\" specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"tilt\", \"safety_checks\", \"adjustment_time\") that are not part of the function signature, causing the function call to fail matching the expected schema. Only the requested \"tilt\" adjustment was needed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"printTime\": \"medium\") in the function call, which caused a schema mismatch and prevented the function call from being recognized as valid by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added non-schema-compliant \"details\" steps within the \"protocol\" argument, deviating from the expected function signature. This caused its function call to not match the required format, resulting in evaluator rejection. The function arguments must strictly follow the provided schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent specified the genre as \"pop\" (lowercase), but the expected function call required \"Pop\" (capitalized). This case sensitivity mismatch led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"dataSources\" argument in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature which only requires \"region\" and \"timeRange\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter within \"checkParameters\", producing non-matching function arguments not accepted by the tool; only \"timeFrame\" was expected, causing the function call mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call, deviating from the expected input schema and causing a mismatch with the available function signature. Only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"equipment\" parameter in its function call, which was not expected or defined for the sports_injury_prevention_analysis tool’s parameters, leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"features\" field as an empty list in the \"simulation_parameters\" of the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema and causing the evaluator to reject it."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent included extra parameters (\"sources\" and \"keywords\") in its function calls that were not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch with the expected minimal \"date_range\" arguments for each call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed one audio file with the light correction intensity and ignored the other two recordings with medium and heavy intensities, failing to call the pronunciation adjustment function for each required intensity and audio file."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent made correct calls to TimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress with accurate locations and historical dates, but it formatted the year \"100\" as \"100-08-01\" instead of the expected zero-padded \"0100-08-01\", causing a strict evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent formatted date strings in \"January 1, 2023\" style instead of the required \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format (\"2023-01-01\"), causing function call argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_49", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON with an extra closing brace, causing parsing failure. This syntactic error in the tool call prevented the benchmark from recognizing the otherwise correct function and parameter selection."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_0", "analysis": "The agent returned the tool call wrapped in XML-like <tool_call> tags instead of providing a pure JSON object, leading to a parsing failure. The core issue is incorrect output formatting for function calls."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\" parameter (\"Immediate\") in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus a failed execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"timePeriod\" and \"details\" with \"cuisineType\" and \"meetingType\") to the function call instead of strictly using the required \"country\" and \"context\" fields as specified by the tool's definition and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter with \"keyLength\": 256 to the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected signature and preventing the evaluator from matching the call despite the correct intent."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" as the museumId in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters and failure to execute the correct API request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") not supported by the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failure to call the function as required."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" instead of \"Paris\" for the location parameter in its function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function call structure which only allowed \"Paris\", resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"analysisDepth\" parameter to \"detailed\" instead of the required \"basic,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters and thus failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed securityOptions as a top-level argument to the function instead of nesting it within each customer data object; this mismatched the expected function schema and caused the evaluator to not recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected function call signature for CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary parameter \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\" in the function call, which was not specified in the expected parameters, leading to a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"destination\" parameter to \"Tokyo, Japan\" instead of the expected \"Tokyo,\" causing a mismatch in function call parameters and resulting in test failure. All other parameters matched expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the function call to TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and consequently a failed function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_31_1", "analysis": "The agent returned the tool call inside an unsupported <tool_call> XML-like wrapper, causing a JSON parsing error. It should have output only the valid JSON tool call object without any extra tags or formatting."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call output did not match the required function call format due to a difference in the parameter naming (\"arguments\" vs. \"parameters\") and a minor mismatch in string casing (\"valuation summary\" vs. \"Valuation summary\"), causing the evaluator to reject it as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"targetGroup\": \"Finance Department\" (capitalized), but the expected parameter was \"targetGroup\": \"finance department\" (lowercase). This case sensitivity mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the function call with correct arguments but wrapped it in non-standard XML-like tags (\"<tool_call> ... </tool_call>\"), resulting in an unparsable format and JSON parse error. The function call should be raw JSON only."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"estimated_time\" field in each task entry, deviating from the required function signature which only accepts \"task_name\" and \"priority\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"#008000\" (a dark green) as the primary color instead of reflecting the user's unspecified but clearly desired bright green (should be \"#00FF00\") for \"green as the primary color,\" indicating a failure to clarify or correctly interpret the user's green color preference."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"influence\" parameter in the function call to cultural_event_classical_music_impact. The expected call only accepts \"period\", \"composer\", and \"date_range\"—any extra parameters cause a function call mismatch."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly paraphrased \"crying a lot\" instead of mapping it to \"excessive crying\" and failed to combine symptoms into \"constant crying and decreased appetite\" for the baby_behaviors parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The model output the temperature range as the string \"18-25\" instead of the expected \"18 to 25\", resulting in a parameter format mismatch that prevented the evaluator from matching the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call used an incorrect argument schema for \"strategy_selector_a\"—including nested structures and field names (e.g., \"customer_demographics\" as an array of objects, overly detailed \"evaluation_criteria\") not matching the expected flattened, more generic parameter format required by the tool."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent provided an overly detailed \"conflict_element\" (\"struggle for control between human authorities and autonomous AI systems\") instead of exactly matching the expected concise term (\"AI control\"), resulting in a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"stress_level\" parameter in the balance_helper_b function call, which was not expected or supported. Only \"diet_preference\" and \"sleep_duration\" should have been provided, causing the function call not to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly resubmitted all tasks including previous ones instead of only scheduling the newly added “Prepare Presentation” task as instructed, and it also failed to map the \"Urgent\" priority to the expected \"High\" priority for this task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the finance_advisor_a function call, using a list instead of a string for \"investment_preferences\" and paraphrased financial status and goals, leading to a mismatch with the expected function argument types and values."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose the syntax_parsing_b tool with custom grammar rules instead of the required syntax_parsing_a tool with the correct \"sentence\" and \"language\" parameters, thus failing to follow the established function usage pattern."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\" for body_type, resulting in an argument mismatch that prevented function call recognition, despite otherwise correct function selection and parameterization."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the unsupported argument \"include_statistics\": true to the eco_vision_B function call, causing a schema mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only \"city_name\" and \"impact_areas\" parameters were allowed."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"activity_level\" parameter when calling health_tips_a, which was not part of the expected function signature. This parameter mismatch caused the call to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call used too brief and generic a problem description, failing to include details about actions already taken and the explicit request for diverse perspectives, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"touch_navigation\" parameter in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, deviating from the expected parameters and the tool's defined interface, resulting in a function call mismatch and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the function poetry_analysis_b instead of the required poetry_analysis_a, despite both having similar descriptions. This indicates a failure to accurately choose the function explicitly requested or expected by the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly labeled the relationship as \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker,\" and added extra explanation (\"causing tension\") to the status field, resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent added extra, unnecessary detail (\"fairly new and currently\") to the current_brand_status parameter instead of matching the expected, concise value \"not well-known,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_47", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"details\" field with unnecessary director information in the function call, instead of matching the expected parameters (\"title\" and \"year\") required by the tool, resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The function description for \"med_aiArticleGen\" is duplicated, leading to ambiguity in tool definitions. The agent may have matched to the incorrect tool description, causing evaluator mismatch despite correct function, arguments, and purpose. This is a tool set configuration error rather than model failure."}

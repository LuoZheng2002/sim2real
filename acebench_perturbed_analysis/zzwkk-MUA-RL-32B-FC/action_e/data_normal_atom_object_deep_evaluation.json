{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_1", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"timeFrame\" parameter at the wrong level in the function arguments; it should be nested within \"queryDetails,\" not at the top level. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call arguments: it placed country, year, voterTurnoutFactors, and votingMethods at the top level instead of nesting them under the required \"votingContext\" parameter, resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_6", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and arguments, but formatted the time values in ISO 8601 with \"Z\" (UTC) instead of the expected format without \"Z\" or timezone information. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the call, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified time ranges (\"09:00-17:00\") for each weekday in the time_restrictions, instead of listing just the weekdays without time ranges as required by the API and the expected parameters. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to nest the input parameters under the \"monumentDetails\" key as required by the function schema; instead, it passed them as top-level arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON included an extra closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON syntax and causing a parsing error. This prevented the system from recognizing and executing the intended function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required parameter format for \"availability\"; it output \"all platforms\" instead of explicitly listing \"iOS, Android, Web\" as specified, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra irrelevant parameter (\"session_length\") in the function call that is not part of the expected schema, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported parameter (\"frequency\": \"weekly\") to the retraining_schedule in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature. Only \"start_time\" and \"end_time\" should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent changed the meeting topic from the user's original phrase (\"launch of our new product\") to \"New Product Launch Discussion,\" failing to preserve the user's wording as required by the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"gear\" information at the root level of the function arguments instead of nesting it under \"hikingDetails,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature. The function call structure did not match the API schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent failed to make the required function call despite having all necessary information. Instead, it incorrectly requested additional details (capacity) not required by the function and did not output any tool call in the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the production_date field outside the beverage_details object, instead of nesting it within as required by the function's expected input schema, resulting in no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual function call arguments. This failure is due to not faithfully replicating required parameter structures, even when settings are empty."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and omitted the required analysis for indirect employment; it should have made two separate function calls, one for direct and one for indirect employment, as requested in the original question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The model placed the \"time\" argument at the wrong nesting level—outside the \"customer\" object—instead of inside it as required by the function signature, resulting in a schema mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter to the content_moderation_analysis function call, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected schema and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}

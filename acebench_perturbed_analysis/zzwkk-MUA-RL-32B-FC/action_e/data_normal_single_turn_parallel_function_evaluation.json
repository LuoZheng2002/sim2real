{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"date\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus a failure to produce the expected output structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent failed to distinguish between the two resistors in the second circuit, using generic \"resistor\" labels in the connections instead of unique identifiers (\"resistor1\" and \"resistor2\"), leading to a non-matching function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent uppercased the value for the \"sport\" parameter (\"Swimming\" instead of the required lowercase \"swimming\"), resulting in a function call mismatch with the expected parameters.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_73", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect assessmentDate (\"2023-01\" instead of the correct \"2022-06\" as expected), failing to align the date parameter with the event timing specified by the task requirements. The rest of the function calls were otherwise correct."}

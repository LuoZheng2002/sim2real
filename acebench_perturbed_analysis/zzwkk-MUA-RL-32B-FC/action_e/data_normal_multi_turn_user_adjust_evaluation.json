{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required DecisionAudit_submitReview function to submit the user's comments and approval, instead only retrieving decision details. It did not perform the main task of submitting the review as explicitly instructed."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function and parameters but incorrectly used the year 2023 for the date range instead of 2024, failing to align with the expected temporal context of the user's next month's visit."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call was provided within <tool_call> tags instead of the required <tool_call></tool_call> format, causing the evaluator not to detect any valid tool invocation. The agent failed to follow the expected output formatting protocol."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent generated incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend_widget\" and \"inventory_level_widget\") instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\" required by the function, resulting in no match with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" in the function call, which are not present in the expected schema, resulting in no exact function call match per benchmark evaluation criteria."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"latest\" as the feedbackId parameter instead of the required \"most-recent\" value, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to correctly call the expected function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the article \"to\" in \"reviewReason\" (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the expected value \"ensure compliance\", causing the function call parameters to mismatch the strict evaluation criteria."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_0", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"insuranceOptions\" parameter at the wrong hierarchy level—outside \"rentalOptions\" instead of nested within it—resulting in a function call schema mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"auditEnabled\": true parameter in its function call to securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and incomplete access control configuration according to the specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly altered the order of the \"repaymentOptions\" array for Bank A's debt, listing \"lump sum\" before \"installments,\" rather than preserving the user-provided order. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Rome\" in the \"location\" parameter as \"Trastevere, Rome\" instead of just \"Trastevere\" as expected, causing the function call to not match exactly with the reference."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent hallucinated a specific restaurant name (\"Trattoria da Enzo\" in Rome) instead of booking a generic \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" near the Colosseum as specified by the user, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent validated the leader type instead of calling the required TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate function to calculate the innovation rates, failing to perform the primary task of analyzing and reporting team innovation metrics as requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the \"preferences\" field, but the expected value was just \"cozy cottage with breakfast.\" The mismatch in preference text caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent called leadership_analyze_visionary_traits instead of the required leadership_compare_two_leaders function, failing to perform the requested comparison between the two leaders as specified in both the original question and available tools."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the correct schedule_meeting function call but used raw XML-like tags (<tool_call>) instead of the required structured function call format, resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect budget range ($100–$200) for booking accommodation instead of the user's specified $1000–$2000, failing to carry the user's budget constraint into the function call as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to update both the communicationModule and the impactAnalysisModule settings, instead of only modifying the communication method from Slack to Email as requested, resulting in extraneous changes to the deployment configuration."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance_cost value ($115.25) instead of the correct quoted option ($120.5 per person) from the insurance options provided earlier. This likely stems from miscalculating or not selecting the correct price, causing the function call arguments to mismatch expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The model omitted required fields: it failed to include \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler (should default to an empty list) and omitted the \"duration\" field in coverage_options, resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the \"desired_qualities\" parameter by changing \"10 years of industry experience\" to \"10+ years industry experience,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature and leading to function call matching failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"travel_dates\" outside of \"user_preferences\" and used inconsistent casing in \"destination_id\" values (\"PARIS\" and \"TOKYO\" instead of \"Paris\" and \"Tokyo\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}

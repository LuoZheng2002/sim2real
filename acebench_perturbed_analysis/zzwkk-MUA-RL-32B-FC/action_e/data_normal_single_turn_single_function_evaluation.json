{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call due to incorrect capitalization of beneficiary names (\"User\" and \"Sister\" instead of \"user\" and \"sister\"), resulting in a mismatch with the required parameters for function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent included time stamps (hours and minutes) in the \"start\" and \"end\" fields instead of the required \"YYYY-MM-DD\" date format, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used \"techdataapi_1\" instead of the required sourceId \"1\" in the dataSources argument, causing the function call not to match the expected parameters and resulting in a failure to execute the intended action."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_17", "analysis": "The agent produced an invalid JSON output with an extra closing brace, causing parsing failure. This formatting error prevented the tool call from being executed, despite the logic and parameters being otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent correctly selected and called ecoMonitor_trackWildlife with appropriate parameters, but its function call output format did not match the expected schema, particularly in the time format (extra 'Z' at the end), causing a mismatch with strict evaluator expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used \"2024\" instead of \"2023\" for campaign dates, set the age range maximum to 30 instead of 35, and the campaign title did not match the expected output. These deviations led to a mismatch in function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\": \"Contemporary\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This incomplete parameterization caused the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly output the tool call with extra closing curly braces, resulting in invalid JSON formatting that could not be parsed. This syntax error prevented successful function invocation despite correct intent and parameter extraction."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required fields: it did not include the \"historical\" parameter and missed \"source_id\" for each traffic source, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature for store_setup_manager."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The model provided the restaurant_id as \"luigis_italian_restaurant\" (a likely internal or lowercased slug), whereas the expected function call required the exact name \"Luigi's Italian Restaurant\". This mismatch prevented proper function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent used a placeholder (\"Provided base64 encoded string\") instead of echoing the actual base64-encoded image string from the user's message in the imageData parameter, leading to a function call mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_52", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the tool call JSON inside non-JSON <tool_call> tags, resulting in invalid output that could not be parsed. The function call should have been delivered as a plain JSON object/array per the tool-calling protocol."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_54", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct function and parameters, but used \"Software\" (capital S) for the industry instead of the expected lowercase \"software,\" likely causing a strict evaluator mismatch despite functionally correct intent and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used \"Green Tea\" with incorrect casing for \"teaName\" instead of the expected \"green tea,\" causing a mismatch with the exact expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_59", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON by including extra closing curly braces, leading to a parsing error. This indicates a formatting mistake in constructing the function call, not in the content or parameter mapping."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile argument, which is not expected by the function signature, causing the function call to not match the required schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON due to an extra closing brace, resulting in a parsing error. It failed to generate a syntactically correct tool call, even though the arguments and tool information were otherwise accurate."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_69", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unnecessary parameter (\"speciesDetails\": []) in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature that only required \"desert\" and \"timePeriod\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_77", "analysis": "The model incorrectly placed \"vibration_patterns\" as a top-level argument instead of nesting it inside \"app_details\" as required by the expected schema, resulting in a structural mismatch that prevented successful function call matching."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call inside extraneous XML-like <tool_call> tags, resulting in invalid JSON with trailing characters.

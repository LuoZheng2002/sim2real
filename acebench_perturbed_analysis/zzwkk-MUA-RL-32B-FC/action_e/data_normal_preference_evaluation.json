{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the resetPassword function, instead asking the user for information that was already implicitly available or should have been assumed as provided in the test context. No tool/function calls were issued despite the clear task request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required \"updateUserProfile\" tool and instead responded with a clarification request, missing the opportunity to take direct action on the user's stated preferences using tool calls."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sports\" instead of \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories, leading to a parameter mismatch. This caused the function call not to match the expected schema, resulting in the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent only updated the user's preferred contact method and failed to verify or update the user's email address and home location as requested, resulting in missing required parameters in the updateUserProfile function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the wrong password (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of \"Jessie90#\") and set the login frequency to \"Weekly\" instead of the expected \"Daily,\" causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent changed the user's email to an incorrect, generated address (\"jessica_newemail@example.com\") instead of retaining the original (\"jessica.l@example.com\") and paraphrased the location too generically (\"Near Austin, TX\" instead of \"a town near Austin, TX\"), failing to preserve required details."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Books\" in the UserPreferredCategories parameter instead of only \"Wellness\" as in the expected function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Platinum\" as the UserMemberStatus instead of \"Bronze\" as required by the expected input, resulting in a function call parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent only provided the updated home location in its function call, omitting required fields such as UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday, resulting in an incomplete updateUserProfile call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_20", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the calculateShippingCost function and instead called fetchUserPreferences, ignoring the user's explicit request for express shipping cost calculation with package size and membership status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required updateUserProfile tool and instead attempted to collect additional information via text, missing the direct function call necessary to update the user's profile as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly prioritized logging in the user instead of calling the processPayment function to handle the payment as requested, completely ignoring the main task described in the user's prompt."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required updateUserProfile tool and instead responded conversationally, asking the user to provide information without issuing any tool calls, resulting in no action taken to update the user's profile as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"Dinner Order\" in the OrderName parameter instead of using the expected lowercase \"dinner order,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the function call as per evaluator requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Burger Place by Elm Park\" instead of the correct restaurant name \"small burger place by the elm park,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Vegetarian\" in the UserDietaryPreference argument, whereas only \"Gluten-Free\" was expected. This mismatch caused the function call arguments not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"OrderName\" as \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected \"dinner order\", causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter value check and resulting in no matching function call found."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly populated the \"UserDietaryPreference\" field instead of setting it to null, leading to a function call mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the correct order name \"sushi order\" in the processPayment function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required UserDietaryPreferences and UserMembershipStatus parameters in its submitReview function call, despite the user explicitly requesting inclusion of loyalty status and implicitly requiring dietary info, leading to an incomplete and mismatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent used the wrong restaurant name (\"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\") and did not correctly include the user's dietary preference (\"Spicy\" instead of \"None\"), leading to a failed function call match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent provided incorrect values for both the refund amount (15.99 instead of 350) and the refund method (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\"), failing to use the user's actual refund preference and correct order amount."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium,\" which was implied by the menu item's name and user's request; thus the function call parameters did not match the expected dietary preference."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required updateUserProfile tool and instead only responded conversationally, not making any function call to actually perform the requested home location update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") as a single string for the \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter instead of providing only \"Vegetarian\" as expected, leading to a mismatch with the required function call signature."}

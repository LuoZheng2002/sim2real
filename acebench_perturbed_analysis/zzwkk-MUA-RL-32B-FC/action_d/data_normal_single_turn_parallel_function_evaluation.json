{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the parameter values for both function calls: it retained \"T00:00:00Z\" timezone suffixes (expected without \"Z\") and summarized trends as \"elegant designs\", \"vibrant colors\" instead of the expected keywords \"elegant\", \"vibrant\". This caused the parameter match failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_11", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"healthIssues\" field for the first user (should be an empty list), resulting in a function call that does not match the expected schema.

These parameter mismatches prevented successful function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent only made a single function call covering one region and time period, instead of issuing separate calls for each specified region and century as requested. It also added an extra parameter (\"interactions\") not present in the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent output the wrong severity value for the \"swelling\" symptom (4 instead of the expected 3) in the ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no matching function call found."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent only called the film search function with a broad parameter and failed to include existentialism as a theme, nor did it analyze Blade Runner with the required existential theme analysis for the specified period.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"advisoryDetails\" parameter in the CityTravelAdvisor_getTravelAdvisories function call, which does not match the expected function signature, resulting in an invalid function call and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_42", "analysis": "The model's function calls were missing the required \"event_details\" parameter, which should be included (even if empty) according to the expected format, leading to a schema mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_44", "analysis": "The agent only submitted a function call for the pond sample, failing to perform calls for the other four water sources specified in the question (well, river, spring, and rainwater); it did not process all requested samples."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"infrastructureResponse\" field in its function arguments and omitted location context in \"vehicleID\", producing incomplete and incorrectly formatted calls that do not match the expected schema for SmartTrafficSystem_manageV2ICommunication."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_49", "analysis": "The agent only called the finance_recommendation_system once for a single user profile, instead of making separate calls for all five provided profiles as required by the question. This caused an incomplete and insufficient response."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"date\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to report a missing or unmatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent failed to specify unique identifiers for components in the second circuit, resulting in an incorrect connection format (\"from\": \"resistor\", \"to\": \"resistor\") instead of matching the expected format with \"resistor1\" and \"resistor2\" for the parallel connection."}

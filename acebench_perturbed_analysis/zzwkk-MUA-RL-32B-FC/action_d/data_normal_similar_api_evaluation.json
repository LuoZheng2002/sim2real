{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize or map user-provided symptoms (\"crying a lot\") to the expected schema (\"excessive crying\") and did not correctly aggregate behaviors as expected, resulting in a function call with mismatched parameters compared to the benchmark's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as \"18-25\" instead of the expected \"18 to 25,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call arguments and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent generated an appropriate function call in structure and intent, but its field values diverged from the expected values (different competitor analysis summary, demographics, and evaluation criteria labels), resulting in no exact function call match per the evaluator’s strictness."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent failed to include \"conflict_element\": \"AI control\" in the function call arguments, omitting the requested conflict aspect and not matching the required parameters for plot_summary_generator_d."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_16", "analysis": "The model formatted function arguments with title casing and labeled keys instead of using the expected lowercase and field names, resulting in a mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"stress_level\" parameter in the function call to balance_helper_b, which is not part of the tool’s expected parameters. Only \"diet_preference\" and \"sleep_duration\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked task_schedule_b instead of task_schedule_a as required by the prior pattern and system instructions. It also failed to transform \"Urgent\" priority to \"High\" and adapt parameter names/structure to match task_schedule_a's specification."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"investment_preferences\" parameter as a list of strings instead of the expected concatenated string, causing a mismatch with the tool's required function signature and resulting in no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the syntax_parsing_b tool instead of syntax_parsing_a, despite the analogous prior context requiring syntax_parsing_a for language-based correctness checks. This resulted in a tool mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" parameter, causing its function call arguments to mismatch the required schema and resulting in the evaluator rejecting the call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported argument (\"include_statistics\": true) in the eco_vision_B function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"activity_level\" in the function call to health_tips_a, which does not match the expected or allowed parameters for this tool, leading to an evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call lacked the necessary detail in the \"problem_description\" parameter; it simply restated the initial issue without incorporating prior debugging steps or context, resulting in insufficiently comprehensive input for the requested perspective-gathering."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_38", "analysis": "The agent included irrelevant SEO-related parameters (keywords, site_structure, content_quality) in the Mobile_optimize_site function call, instead of restricting to the required parameters (responsive_design, load_speed), causing a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent provided the function call with an incorrect key (\"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\") and added unnecessary detail (\"causing tension\") not present in the expected output, leading to mismatched argument formatting and failed function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The agent used \"The importance of love\" instead of the expected \"importance of love\" for the theme parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call despite otherwise correct tool and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent used \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" as the current_brand_status parameter instead of matching the required normalized value \"not well-known,\" leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"details\" field (with director info) in the function call; the tool expected only \"title\" and \"year\" parameters, resulting in no match and a failed invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The failure was caused by a mismatched case in the \"title\" parameter (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs \"AI applications in oncology\"), leading to strict evaluator mismatch despite correct tool use and parameter intent."}

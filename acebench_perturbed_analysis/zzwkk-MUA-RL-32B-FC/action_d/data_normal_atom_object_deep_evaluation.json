{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call inside extra XML-like <tool_call> tags and used the wrong key structure (\"arguments\" and a misplaced \"timeFrame\" block), producing invalid JSON that could not be parsed and did not conform to the function's expected parameter schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed voterTurnoutFactors and votingMethods at the top level of the function call arguments instead of nesting them inside the votingContext object as required by the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_6", "analysis": "The model output used the correct function and arguments but formatted the startTime and endTime fields with a \"Z\" (indicating UTC) instead of the expected ISO 8601 format without the \"Z\", causing an exact argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified detailed time ranges for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" field, instead of only listing the applicable days as required. This resulted in a function call signature mismatch with the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function signature by passing \"monumentID\" and \"materialSamples\" at the top level, instead of nesting them under a \"monumentDetails\" object as required by the function schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_9", "analysis": "The agent outputted malformed JSON with an extra closing curly brace, resulting in a parsing failure. The root issue is incorrect JSON formatting in the tool call, not the function choice or parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported \"feedback_options\" parameters to the publicSpeaking_coach function call, deviating from the expected schema which only accepts \"session_details\"; this caused a schema mismatch and failure to match the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to correctly specify the \"availability\" parameter for the fireworks safety app, returning \"all platforms\" instead of the required explicit platforms (\"iOS, Android, Web\") as per the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added \"venueRequirements\": {\"minimumCapacity\": 500} to the function call arguments, which is not supported by the expected function signature and caused the call to mismatch the evaluator's template."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"frequency\" field to the \"retraining_schedule\" parameter when calling ai_security_model_hardening, which is not part of the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly paraphrased the meeting topic as \"New Product Launch Discussion\" instead of using the exact phrasing \"Launch of our new product\" given by the user, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information outside the \"hikingDetails\" object instead of nesting it within as required by the function's expected parameters, resulting in a schema mismatch and failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The root cause is a schema mismatch: the model's function call used \"arguments\" instead of the required \"parameters\" key for the function payload, resulting in the call not matching the expected interface and thus not being recognized or executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed production_date at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it within beverage_details as required by the beverage_compliance_check function schema, resulting in a schema mismatch and evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the empty \"settings\": {} object in the summary widget for the second dashboard, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure and causing an evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment impact, failing to make a separate function call for indirect employment as requested by the user. Both direct and indirect employment analyses were required for full task completion."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested the \"time\" parameter inside the \"customer\" object and used \"arguments\" instead of the required \"parameters\" key, resulting in a function call structure mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" to the content_moderation_analysis function call, which caused it not to match the available tool's signature and led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}

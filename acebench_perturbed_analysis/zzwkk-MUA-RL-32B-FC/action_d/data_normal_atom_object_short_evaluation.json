{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"emotion_depth\" parameter to the \"context\" object in the function call, making the call signature not match the tool's specification, which expects only \"culture\" within \"context\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_9", "analysis": "The model included an extra \"safety_checks\" field with a nested structure in the locking_mechanism parameter, which does not match the required function signature; only \"status\" was expected. This resulted in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call by placing the parameter objects under an \"arguments\" key instead of directly under the \"parameters\" key, resulting in a mismatch with the expected API structure and evaluator requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used the lowercase \"pop\" for the genre instead of the capitalized \"Pop\" expected by the function schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" argument in the function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch. Only \"region\" and \"timeRange\" were expected; the extra argument prevented successful function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"intensity\" parameter to the checkParameters object in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's defined parameter schema and causing the function call to fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameters in the function call, which did not match the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to invoke the correct function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra non-parameter keys (\"features\") in the function call payload that are not supported by the function signature, resulting in no match with the expected valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"instructorPreference\" field with a name and rating to the MindfulSessionScheduler_scheduleYogaStream function call, which was not requested or provided by the user, resulting in a parameter mismatch and function call rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent only processed the \"recording_light.mp3\" file with \"light\" intensity, ignoring the other two recordings and intensity levels, thus failing to make the required three separate function calls for all provided audio files and preferences."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent formatted the year for the Colosseum query as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required four-digit \"0100-08-01\", causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_49", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON for the tool call by including unnecessary extra closing braces, causing a parsing error and preventing the tool invocation from being processed as intended."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent over-specified function arguments by adding unnecessary fields (\"timePeriod\", \"details\" with \"cuisineType\" and \"meetingType\") instead of only providing \"country\" and \"context\" as expected, resulting in a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input schema and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}

This caused a schema mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" as the museumId parameter, leading to a mismatched function call and failure to meet the expected input format for the tool."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"translationFeatures\" field with options (idiomaticExpressions, culturalInsights, pronunciationAdjustments) to the function call arguments, which are not accepted by the function schema and caused a mismatch with the expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call used the argument key \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" as required by the tool's specification, resulting in a mismatch despite otherwise correct content. This schema error caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the value for \"targetGroup\" as \"Finance Department\" instead of matching the expected lowercase \"finance department,\" leading to a mismatch and subsequent function call evaluation failure."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required resetPassword tool and instead responded with a request for user input, despite already having all necessary information to execute the function. It did not produce any tool/function call as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required updateUserProfile tool and instead responded conversationally, asking follow-up questions. It did not perform any function call to actually update the user profile as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent output \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent only attempted to update the user's preferred contact method, neglecting to verify and update other required profile fields (email, home location, language, time zone, birthday), resulting in an incomplete updateUserProfile function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect password and supplied the wrong login frequency (\"Weekly\" instead of the correct \"Daily\"), resulting in a loginUser call with mismatched parameters to the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated the user's email to \"jessica_newemail@example.com\" instead of retaining \"jessica.l@example.com\" or confirming the new email from the user's input, and paraphrased \"a town near Austin, TX\" as simply \"Near Austin, TX,\" failing to exactly match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" as \"Books, Wellness\" instead of only \"Wellness\" as expected, likely due to not properly filtering or selecting the relevant user preference for this product type."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent used \"Platinum\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the required \"Bronze,\" failing to extract the correct value from the user's actual membership status in the world state for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the new home location, omitting required fields such as UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday, which are needed for a complete and valid profile update according to the function specification."}
{"id": "normal_preference_20", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the calculateShippingCost function, which was necessary to determine the express delivery cost with the given package dimensions and membership status; instead, it inappropriately called fetchUserPreferences, missing the core task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly requested more information from the user instead of extracting and using the already provided email and city details to make the required updateUserProfile tool call, resulting in no function call being made."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to log in the user instead of invoking the processPayment function directly, failing to process the payment as requested by the user. It ignored the central task specified in the question."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the updateUserProfile tool and instead responded only with a message asking for user input, neglecting to make the required function call with the available information from the user profile."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent capitalized \"Dinner Order\" in the OrderName parameter instead of using the expected lowercase \"dinner order,\" leading to a mismatch with the evaluator's required function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to log in the user instead of calling the viewReviews function to retrieve restaurant reviews filtered by rating, failing to address the user's actual request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed \"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\" as UserDietaryPreference instead of just \"Gluten-Free\" as required by the expected output, resulting in no matching function call. The agent added an extra dietary preference not specified in the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), causing an exact match failure with the expected function call. All other fields matched; the error is due to case sensitivity in the order name."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the precise restaurant name (\"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter instead of handling it internally or omitting it as expected, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"OrderName\" to \"Sushi Platter\" instead of \"sushi order\", failing to match the parameter in the expected function call, which caused the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required UserDietaryPreferences and UserMembershipStatus parameters in the submitReview function call, despite the user explicitly requesting their loyalty status be included with the review. This led to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the RestaurantName parameter, failing to match the user's specified restaurant and resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect refund parameters: it refunded $15.99 to the original payment method instead of issuing a 350 unit store credit, and did not match the expected user refund preference or amount."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of the requested \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align the function call parameters with the user's stated dietary preference."}

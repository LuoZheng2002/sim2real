{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_2", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous \"signature_options\" parameters in the function call that are not supported by the entertainment_manage_contracts tool, causing a mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only contract_details should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified precise time ranges (00:00-23:59) for each weekday in \"time_restrictions\" instead of simply listing the weekdays as per the expected structure, resulting in a function call argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix from the sampleIDs (\"Sample A\", \"Sample B\") in its function call, instead passing just \"A\" and \"B\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected API parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The model placed the \"capacity\" parameter at the top level of the function call instead of nesting it within \"search_criteria\", resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected tool input format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required participantData field in the privacy object of the sessionDetails, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters for ConferenceSessionManager_createSession."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function arguments, deviating from the required schema, which caused a mismatch with the expected function call format for mood_enhancing_playlist_generator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the input for ContentOptimizer_applyML by placing \"articles\" and \"userPreferences\" at the top level of \"contentData\" instead of nesting them under a single \"articles\" key as required by the function's expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to map participant cultures to their proper demonyms (\"Vietnamese,\" \"British,\" \"Spanish\"), instead using country names, which led to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call by placing the gear information outside the hikingDetails object, instead of nesting it within hikingDetails as required by the expected function call schema, resulting in a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call payload: it placed \"community\" details at the top level instead of including them within the \"integration_details\" object as required by the tool's expected input schema, resulting in no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its tool call, resulting in a parsing failure. This prevented execution of the correct function call to adjust the white noise machine settings as requested. Proper JSON formatting was not maintained."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the \"time\" parameter as \"08:00\" instead of the full operating hours \"08:00-17:00\", and included an extra \"capacity\" parameter not required by the function, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object for the summary widget in the second dashboard function call. This led to a mismatch with the expected parameters, causing the evaluator to not recognize the model's output as a correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON missing closing braces, causing a parsing failure. Additionally, it used a penalty value of 0.1 instead of the specified 10 (likely confusing percentage with an absolute amount), resulting in incorrect parameterization of the API calls for some reservations."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment impact, omitting the analysis for indirect employment as required by the question. It should have issued two function calls: one for direct and another for indirect employment impact."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"time_constraints\" field in each configure_ipsec_vpn function call, which is not part of the expected parameters. This caused the function signatures to not match, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"time\" parameter at the top level of the payload instead of nesting it inside the \"customer\" object as required by the function specification, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent generated malformed JSON in the tool call by including an extraneous quotation mark after the responseTeams array, causing a syntax error and preventing correct parsing of the function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported argument (\"analysis_depth\") in the function call to content_moderation_analysis, resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported parameters \"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\" in the SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery function call, which do not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter (\"printTime\") in the function call to artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer that is not part of the expected or supported parameters, causing a mismatch with the function signature and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and overly detailed protocol steps (\"details\" field) in the function arguments, resulting in malformed JSON output that could not be parsed, instead of adhering to the tool's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent specified the genre as \"pop\" (lowercase) instead of \"Pop\" (capitalized), causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call which uses \"Pop\"—leading to no match being found."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unnecessary \"examples\" key within the \"organismDetails\" parameter, deviating from the required function signature, which resulted in a mismatch and failure to execute the function call as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"dataSources\" argument in the function call that was not supported by the ecoMonitor_analyzeLandUse tool, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"eventTypes\" parameter in its function call, but only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" are accepted. This caused a mismatch with available tool signatures and resulted in failure to recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") in the simulation_parameters that were not requested by the user and are not part of the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent added extra, unsupported parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") to the function calls instead of matching the required minimal \"date_range\" parameter, causing a mismatch with the available \"technews_fetch_latest_ai_developments\" tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" parameter in the correctionPreferences, causing the function calls to not match the expected schema which only accepts the \"intensity\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect coordinate values and did not properly format the year in \"0100-08-01\" (used \"100-08-01\" instead), leading to function calls that did not match the expected parameters and thus were not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the CeramicAnalyzer_compareManufactureTechniques function using incomplete and irrelevant sample details, instead of making two separate calls to CeramicAnalyzer_identifyCeramicType with the specific properties provided for each sample as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_41", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified \"bamboo\" material and \"S\" initial size for the first subscription, incorrectly using \"cotton\" and \"XS\" instead, showing a failure to accurately extract and use crucial user-provided parameters in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_44", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"terms\" parameter in its function call. This extra argument caused a mismatch with the expected input schema, so the evaluator could not recognize the function call as valid."}

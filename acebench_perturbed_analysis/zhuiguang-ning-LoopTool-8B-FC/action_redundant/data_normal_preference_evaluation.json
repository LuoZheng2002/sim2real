{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent fabricated and used incorrect security question and answer details (\"What is the name of your first pet?\", \"Max\") instead of correctly extracting and using the provided security question and answer (\"What is your mother's maiden name?\", \"Smith\") required for the password reset."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories, resulting in a parameter mismatch against the expected function call schema, which caused the evaluator to reject the addToCart operation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and altered the password (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of \"Jessie90#\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected \"loginUser\" signature and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the leading article \"a\" in \"a town near Austin, TX\" when updating UserHomeLocation, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call; otherwise, function choice and other values were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assumed the user's membership status was \"Platinum\" instead of using the correct \"Bronze\" status, leading to an unmatched function call and failure to produce the expected result."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserSpendingLimit parameter to 1000 instead of the user's actual preferred/regular spending limit of 350, indicating a failure to retrieve or use the correct user-specific limit as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent updated only the UserHomeLocation without preserving or including all other required existing profile fields, resulting in an incomplete updateUserProfile call that did not match the expected parameter set."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Platinum\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the expected \"Gold,\" leading to a mismatch with the required function call parameters and failure to match the evaluator's expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the fields mentioned in the user request, omitting other required profile fields (language, timezone, birthday), resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but used the wrong order status (\"Pending\" instead of \"Out for Delivery\"). It failed to retrieve or infer the actual current order status needed for an accurate update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided multiple dietary preferences in a single string for the UserDietaryPreference parameter instead of only using the specified \"Gluten-Free\" as in the expected output, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the new password to \"Jessie90#new\" instead of using the provided password \"Jessie90#,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus failing to process the payment as specified."}

{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model's function call used \"OrderName\": \"Dinner Order\" (with uppercase), while the expected parameter was \"OrderName\": \"dinner order\" (lowercase), causing an exact match failure on argument case sensitivity, despite all other arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter instead of omitting it or setting it to null as expected by the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the expected \"sushi order,\" causing a mismatch in function call parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly populated the UserDietaryPreferences field with [\"Gluten-Free\"] instead of the expected [\"None\"], introducing unintended preference information not provided or inferred from the user's input."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect parameter values: it substituted \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the restaurant, and \"Vegan\" instead of \"Spicy\" for the dietary preference, failing to accurately map user context to function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the initiatePartialRefund function instead of the required processRefund function, and failed to handle the user's refund preference and the correct refund amount as specified in the task and tool descriptions."}

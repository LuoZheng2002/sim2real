{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to use the specialized function for examining persistent vein visibility and associated symptoms as required by the input and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent generated function call arguments that did not match the required schema: it used phrase descriptions instead of concise field values, altered field names (e.g., \"brand_recognition_improvement\" instead of \"brand_recognition\"), and supplied different customer demographics and competitor analysis details than expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly altered the required value for the \"conflict_element\" parameter, using \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected and correct \"AI control,\" resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to reschedule all tasks, including the new one, and used the unrecognized \"Urgent\" priority instead of updating only with the \"Prepare Presentation\" task and adjusting its priority to match the expected \"High,\" resulting in a mismatched function call and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose the finance_advisor_b tool instead of the required finance_advisor_a tool, despite both being available and finance_advisor_a explicitly matching the task’s requirements. This indicates a failure in tool selection, not in parameter extraction or reasoning."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"age_range\" to \"20-25\" instead of \"25-30\" and \"body_type\" to \"medium build\" instead of \"medium\", causing a mismatch with the expected parameter schema and preventing function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"include_statistics\" parameter in its call to eco_vision_B, causing no exact match to the expected function signature; only \"city_name\" and \"impact_areas\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a, as required. It also omitted the \"age\" parameter, and did not match the parameters expected for health_tips_a. This shows an error in choosing the correct tool and parameter mapping."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call provided only a brief summary of the problem, omitting the additional details about checked steps and the explicit need for diverse perspectives that the user stated, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly repeated the call to analyze_social_data_a instead of switching to analyze_social_data_b as required for further or alternative analysis; it also did not update evaluation_metrics to include only \"F1 score\" as specified by the follow-up user request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called poetry_analysis_b instead of the required poetry_analysis_a function, despite both tools being available. This indicates a misidentification or confusion between similar function names rather than a misunderstanding of the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose the conflict resolution tool instead of the motivation tool, addressing conflict resolution rather than providing recommendations for building better workplace relationships, as specifically requested by the user."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent's function arguments did not match the expected values: it used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group, and gave extra descriptive context (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") instead of the concise \"not well-known\" for current_brand_status."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but used \"AI Applications in Oncology\" (title-cased) instead of the expected \"AI applications in oncology\" (lowercase 'a'). The mismatch in letter casing caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to convert the provided date range \"March 8 to March 22\" into the required ISO date format (\"2024-03-08\", \"2024-03-22\") in its function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent called PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback with only the employeeId but omitted the required feedbackId parameter (\"most-recent\"), resulting in an incomplete and incorrect function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only created the \"Supervisor\" role inheriting from \"Admin\" but failed to explicitly set up the \"Admin\" and \"User\" roles as required; all three roles needed to be initialized in the function call for correct setup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_3_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested the travel_dates within user_preferences instead of at the top level of the function parameters, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch with the expected virtual_travel_guide function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required notifications parameter (with enableAlerts and alertTime) in its festival_art_schedule_creator function call, resulting in an incomplete payload that did not match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required location detail \"near the Colosseum\" when calling book_dining, specifying only \"Rome\" instead of the user's preference, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" parameter (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call arguments and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect innovation rate for Team Alpha (65.0 instead of the correct 70) when calling the reporting function, indicating it did not extract and propagate the per-team innovation rates accurately from the prior step."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called schedule_gift_delivery instead of the required send_gift function. The task was to send the gift, not schedule its delivery for a future date, so the wrong tool was used."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct schedule_meeting function call, but used a lowercased agenda (\"finalize and sign the contract\") instead of matching the expected capitalization (\"Finalize and sign the contract\"), resulting in an exact match failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"activityLevel\" key under \"touristPreferences\", which is not part of the expected function parameters, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences field, but the expected value was \"cozy cottage with breakfast.\" This mismatch in the \"preferences\" parameter caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters and thus failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter (\"overall_experience\") in the function call, which was not present in the expected output. This caused a mismatch with the required parameters for manage_feedback_collection, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance_cost value ($110) when calling travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget, instead of the correct total ($120.5) per the best-coverage insurance returned previously. This indicates a failure to select and apply the appropriate insurance option."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter (\"2024-01-03\") in the travelDates for the travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals call, despite the user clearly specifying travel dates for a round trip."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the team led by the transactional leader and incorrectly included it in the function call, instead of restricting the calculation to only teams with transformational leaders as required by the tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The model outputted the correct function name and nearly correct arguments, but changed \"10 years of industry experience\" to \"at least 10 years of industry experience\" in desired_qualities, causing an argument mismatch with the exact-string match evaluator."}

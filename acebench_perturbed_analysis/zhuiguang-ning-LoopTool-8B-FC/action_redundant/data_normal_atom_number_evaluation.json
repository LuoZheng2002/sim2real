{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" argument to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator call, which does not match the expected or available function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the minimum rating (\"minRating\": 4) parameter in the LocalFoodDeliverySearch function call, resulting in a broader search instead of filtering for highly-rated options as requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent used significantly incorrect values for serviceSectorGrowth (0.5 instead of 5.6) and foreignInvestment (300 instead of 900), indicating it hallucinated or defaulted these parameters instead of correctly retrieving or inferring them for Guangdong, leading to a failed function call match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the actual reported message delay (\"receptionDelay\": 1200) in the MessageReceptionChecker function call, defaulting to 0 instead of extracting the user's real issue of delayed message arrival, leading to an incorrect or irrelevant function call."}

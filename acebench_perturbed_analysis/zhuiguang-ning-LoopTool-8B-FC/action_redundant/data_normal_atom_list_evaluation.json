{"id": "normal_atom_list_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"dayOfWeek\" to Saturday, while the expected function call used Sunday; the question only specifies \"this weekend\" with no clear day, but the benchmark expects Sunday, leading to a parameter mismatch and failed function call match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_5", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the values in the \"businessType\" list as [\"Cafe\", \"Bakery\"] instead of using the expected lowercase [\"cafe\", \"bakery\"], causing a mismatch with the required function call argument format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"targetAudience\" parameter in the function call to TemplateRecommender_suggestTemplates, which was not part of the required parameters, causing the call signature to not match the expected input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called DeviceVerification_checkDeviceEligibility instead of DeviceVerification_verifyDevice, failing to perform the required verification step as specified by the user's request and the expected function call for verifying device details before recycling."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_25", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with appropriate arguments, but it incorrectly capitalized \"Winter\" instead of using the lowercase \"winter\" as required by the API, causing an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"apiKey\" and \"refreshRate\") in the function call to GlobalAirQuality_queryCities, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_list_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"visitDuration\" in its DisneyFamilyPlan_suggestRides function call; only \"childrenAges\" is permitted, causing the function call not to match the expected schema."}

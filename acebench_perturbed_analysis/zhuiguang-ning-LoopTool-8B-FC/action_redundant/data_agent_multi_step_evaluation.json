{"id": "agent_multi_step_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to send the required confirmation message (“Already bought.”) back to Grace after completing the purchase, neglecting the explicit instruction in Grace's original request and thus did not fully satisfy the task requirements."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_13", "analysis": "The agent failed to turn on Wi-Fi before attempting actions requiring network access. As a result, subsequent tool calls (such as searching products or fulfilling the order) could not execute as expected, preventing task completion."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly tried to log in as Frank to the food delivery platform instead of using Eve's credentials, got stuck on password error, and never executed the food order, message deletion, or message sending steps required to complete the tasks."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to log into the food platform using Frank's credentials instead of Eve's, despite being tasked as Eve and having Eve's password. This blocked progress on the required order and all subsequent tasks."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to log in to the food platform as Frank using the wrong password, instead of logging in as Eve (whose credentials were provided) to place the order and complete the reminder tasks as Eve."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to place the food order as Frank—including trying to log in as Frank—rather than as Eve (the acting user). It got stuck on authentication errors, failing to realize Eve should have used her own account to complete the tasks."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_18", "analysis": "The agent sent the \"See you tomorrow\" message to Frank twice, resulting in two identical messages in the inbox. It ignored the result of its first successful send after enabling Wi-Fi and unnecessarily repeated the entire message-sending and deletion logic."}

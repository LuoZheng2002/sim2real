{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"printTime\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the expected schema, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used the genre parameter value \"pop\" (lowercase) instead of \"Pop\" (title case) as expected by the evaluator, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_19", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included an unnecessary \"examples\" field within the \"organismDetails\" parameter structure, causing a mismatch with the expected tool function signature. This extra field led to the function call not matching the available tool's specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" parameter in the function call payload, which did not match the expected function signature, causing the call to be unrecognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_22", "analysis": "The agent included an extra period at the end of the \"content\" argument, making the string \"Exploring the Future of AI Technologies.\" instead of the expected \"Exploring the Future of AI Technologies\", leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous \"eventTypes\" parameters in the function call that are not supported or expected by the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline tool, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function execution."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"features\" field with extra options in the \"simulation_parameters\" instead of limiting its output to the parameters specified in the tool schema, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") not supported by the function signature, instead of only providing the required \"date_range\". This caused its calls to not match the expected function calls, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used imprecise latitude/longitude values (lng off by 0.0002 for Eiffel Tower and Colosseum) and formatted the Colosseum year as \"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01,\" causing function call mismatches despite correct tool usage intent."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The model included a \"Z\" (indicating UTC time) at the end of the timestamp values in its function call, whereas the expected format omitted the \"Z\". This mismatch in datetime format led to the evaluator rejecting the call."}

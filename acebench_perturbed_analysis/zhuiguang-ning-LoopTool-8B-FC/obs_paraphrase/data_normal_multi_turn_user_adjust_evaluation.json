{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call semantically matched the task, but the reviewComments field used user-provided wording (\"clear and well-recorded\") instead of the expected phrasing (\"transparent and well-documented\"). The evaluator required an exact text match, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used the year 2023 instead of 2024 for the requested date range, failing to align the function call with the user's travel timeframe and the expected scheduling parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_7_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call used paraphrased comments rather than exactly matching the expected wording, indicating a lack of strict adherence to the reference response. The core failure is the model's inability to preserve required comment phrasing for deterministic evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent called the analysis function with \"feedbackId\": \"latest\" instead of the expected \"most-recent\", failing to match the required function signature and thus was not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only created the 'Supervisor' role inherited from 'Admin' but failed to include the previously defined 'Admin' and 'User' roles in the securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles call, resulting in an incomplete role specification."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_18_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call specified \"priceRange\": \"150 euros\" instead of the required \"up to 150 euros per night,\" omitting the \"per night\" qualifier and the upper-limit intent, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted \"per night\" from the budget parameter in the function call, providing just \"$150\" instead of the required \"$150 per night\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_3_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call by omitting the required nesting: it placed travel_dates at the top level and did not nest all user preferences (including travel_dates) under user_preferences as specified in the function signature."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (with alert preferences) when calling festival_art_schedule_creator, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not conform to the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updatedToolSettings when only the \"method\": \"Email\" change was requested. The function call should have updated only the \"method\", not duplicated existing parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect widget_id \"inventory_status\" instead of the expected \"inventory_levels\" for the inventory dashboard component, resulting in a function call that did not match the benchmark's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent booked a restaurant named \"Classic Italian Trattoria\" with the location as \"Rome\" and added \"Close to the Colosseum\" as a special request, instead of booking \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" with the correct location \"near the Colosseum\" as specified in the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"influencer collaborations\" instead of the required \"influencer partnerships\" as the Instagram strategy, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent scheduled the meeting with the agenda \"complete and sign the contract\" instead of the expected \"Finalize and sign the contract,\" causing a mismatch in the function call parameters and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent generated a report using an incorrect, averaged innovation rate (65% for both teams) instead of using the correct individual innovation rates (70% for Team Alpha and 60% for Team Beta) as provided in the input data."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"cuisine\" as a tourist interest instead of mapping it to the expected \"food\" keyword, resulting in a parameter mismatch for the function call and failure to align with the accepted input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required insurance_cost parameter in the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget function call, even though the insurance cost ($120.5) was available from prior tool outputs and should have been included per the tool’s specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter with demand-driven algorithm and forecasting true in its function call, omitting key details necessary for the travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals tool to apply demand forecasting and revenue management."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call did not match the expected strict parameters; specifically, it used \"comfortable cottage that includes breakfast\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast\" for the preferences field, causing the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"feedback_type\" in the manage_feedback_collection function call, which was not expected, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature."}

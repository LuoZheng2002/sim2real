{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call arguments by omitting the required \"votingContext\" wrapper, passing parameters at the top level instead of nesting them within \"votingContext\" as expected by the API schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added detailed \"time_range\" specifications for each weekday instead of simply restricting encryption to the listed weekdays (Monday–Friday) as required. The argument structure did not match the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"amenities\" parameter in the FamilyGatheringVenueFinder function call, which is not supported by the tool's expected input schema, resulting in a mismatched function call. Only \"search_criteria\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call because it returned \"afternoon\" and \"evening\" with lowercase initial letters in \"timeOptions\" instead of capitalized \"Afternoon\" and \"Evening\" as required by the tool's input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field within the \"privacy\" object in its function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameter schema for ConferenceSessionManager_createSession."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the \"contentData\" argument as a list of articles rather than nesting articles under an \"articles\" key within an object, and also misplaced \"userPreferences,\" leading to a function call schema mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to map participant cultures to their adjectival forms (Vietnamese, British, Spanish) as expected and did not match the meeting topic wording (\"New product rollout\" vs. \"Launch of our new product\"), resulting in non-matching function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information at the top level of the function arguments instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function schema, leading to a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent produced an incomplete JSON object in its tool call output (missing a closing brace), causing a parsing error and preventing the function call from being executed as intended."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent generated a tool call with correct logic but returned invalid JSON syntax, likely due to missing or mismatched brackets or improper formatting, causing the evaluator to fail parsing the output. The root issue is improper JSON serialization of the tool call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included a period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"certifications\" field in its beverage_compliance_check calls, deviating from the expected parameter schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function calls as valid matches."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_36", "analysis": "The agent outputted incorrect values for the \"lightSource\" field (\"halogen lamp\", \"halogen light source\", \"UV light\") instead of the expected normalized values (\"halogen\", \"UV\"), causing its function calls to not match the expected schema exactly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent serialized the penalty for same-day cancellations as 0.1 (float) instead of the required integer value 10 (representing 10%) in the function arguments, and also output invalid JSON due to missing closing braces in the tool call payloads."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment impact and failed to perform a separate analysis for indirect employment, resulting in a missing function call for the \"Indirect\" employmentType as required by the original question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"winePreferences\" argument as an object in the function calls, which does not match the expected schema for pairing_cheeseWineMatcher, leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON is malformed due to a missing closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON that cannot be parsed or executed. This indicates a failure in generating syntactically correct function call output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extra quotation mark after the closing bracket for the \"responseTeams\" list, causing a syntax error that prevented the function call from being parsed and executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" parameter unsupported by the content_moderation_analysis function, resulting in a function call mismatch and failure to properly invoke the required tool with only the allowed parameters."}

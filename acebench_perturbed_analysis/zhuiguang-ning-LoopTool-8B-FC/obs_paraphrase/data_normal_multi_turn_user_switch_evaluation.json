{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_10_0", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary parameters (\"details\": {\"theme\": \"historical\", \"features\": [...]}) to the cultural_experience_finder function call, resulting in a call signature that did not match the function's expected arguments and thus was not recognized as correct by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions function call, resulting in a non-matching function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_10_1", "analysis": "The agent used different wording for the \"activities\" field (\"visiting historical landmarks\" instead of \"historical sites\") in the function call, causing an exact match failure with the evaluator's stricter parameter expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in its function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_4_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call did not match because it output the function call in a tool_call XML-like tag instead of the required plain JSON format for ACEBench, leading to a mismatch with expected outputs despite correct content."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"translationFeatures\" field with options not required or accepted by the function's defined signature, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to make a valid function call as specified by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra argument, \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\", in the function call that is not part of the expected parameters, causing a mismatch with the required function signature. The function should only include \"demographicFilters\"."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected #008000 (a dark green) as the primary color instead of the user's implicit preference for bright green, which matches #00FF00. The mismatch in color code led to the function call not matching expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect \"museumId\" (\"Louvre\" instead of \"LouvreMuseum\"), set \"guidedTour\" to true instead of the expected false, and provided a non-empty \"mustSeeExhibits\" list, resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter when calling TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema.

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the wording of the second question from \"What improvements would you recommend?\" to \"What improvements would you suggest?\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"influence\" parameter to the function call, deviating from the required parameter structure. This caused a mismatch with the expected schema for the \"cultural_event_classical_music_impact\" tool, resulting in the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_0", "analysis": "The agent paraphrased the user's \"market_trends\" data instead of reproducing it precisely as provided, violating the requirement for an exact match of input details for function arguments, which led to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_48_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Archaeological Site\" as a siteType instead of only \"Monument\" as specified in the expected function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected tool invocation."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call for hiking_fitness_preparation only included the training schedule for week 1, instead of properly generating a repeated schedule covering multiple weeks as implied by the user's 10-day trek preparation.

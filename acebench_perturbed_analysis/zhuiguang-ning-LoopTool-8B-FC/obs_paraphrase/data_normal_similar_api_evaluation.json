{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the tool that specifically addresses vein visibility with associated symptoms as described in the question and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent provided a function call with the temperature_range parameter as \"18 to 25 degrees Celsius\" instead of the expected format \"18 to 25\", resulting in a mismatch with the tool's required argument schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_6", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"hydration_level\" parameter to \"high\" instead of the expected \"medium,\" misinterpreting the user's description of being \"reasonably well-hydrated.\" This parameter mismatch prevented a function call match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent used user-provided responses verbatim instead of transforming or generalizing them to match the required function schema (e.g., specific goals, criteria, and correct demographic details), resulting in mismatched parameter names and values for strategy_selector_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly paraphrased the \"conflict_element\" from \"struggle for control over AI\" (user input) to \"struggle for control over AI\" (output) instead of exactly matching the expected string \"AI control\", leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_16", "analysis": "The agent's argument wording (\"women between 30 and 45 years old living in urban environments\" and \"boost both brand awareness and sales\") did not exactly match the expected parameter phrasing, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call due to strict string matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the user's input by passing \"healthy food choices\" instead of the expected keyword \"healthy\" for the diet_preference parameter, causing a parameter mismatch with the function's specification."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included all four tasks in the function call instead of updating the schedule to include only the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task. It also misrepresented the priority as \"Urgent\" rather than converting it to \"High\" as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments did not match the expected schema: it used less formal, slightly paraphrased descriptions for goals, investment preferences, and financial status instead of closely mirroring the client's original phrasing as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"timeline_slider\" interactive element in the function call, which was not requested in the user prompt or expected output, resulting in a mismatch with the allowed parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"age_range\" parameter to \"20-25\" instead of \"25-30,\" failing to accurately map the user's age (26) into the correct range as expected by the function's specification."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_26", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with appropriate parameters, but the order of \"topics_of_interest\" (\"science\", \"technology\") differed from the expected order (\"technology\", \"science\"), leading to a strict matching failure. The agent should preserve parameter array order when required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to clarity_guide_b used an inadequate and generic problem description instead of carrying forward the more detailed and contextualized description, resulting in a lack of specificity and completeness required by the evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"target\" values for each dataset entry when calling model_optimizer_y, despite the user providing them and these being necessary inputs for feature selection. This led to a mismatch with the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required function call parameters due to mismatches in the \"relation\" (\"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\") and \"status\" (\"frequently disagree on sales approaches\" instead of \"often disagree on sales techniques\"), leading to no function call match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_42", "analysis": "The model used the parameter \"theme\": \"significance of love\" instead of the required \"theme\": \"importance of love\", causing a mismatch with the expected function call despite the rest of the arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent used parameter values that did not exactly match the required format—specifically, it used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group, and \"relatively new and not widely recognized in the mainstream market\" instead of the expected \"not well-known\" for current_brand_status."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent used a title (\"The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Oncology\") that does not exactly match the expected title (\"AI applications in oncology\"), leading to a strict string mismatch in the function call parameters, despite the rest of the call being correct."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter (\"keyLength\": 256) to the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema for DataGuard_encryptBusinessData and thus failing to produce a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the user's instructions and the expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"France\" in the \"location\" parameter (\"Paris, France\") instead of just \"Paris\" as expected by the function schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the function call to not be recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in the function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a payload that did not match the expected function signature and failed to meet the benchmark criteria."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Louvre\" instead of \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId, populated mustSeeExhibits when none were specified, and omitted the provided digital map navigation option. These deviations from the expected parameter format caused the function call to not match the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument \"analysisDepth\": \"deep\" to the CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent submitted the correct function call but failed due to a capitalization mismatch in the \"details\" field value (\"valuation summary for properties involved\" vs. \"Valuation summary for properties involved\"), preventing an exact match with the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required group_size parameter in the function call to cultural_tour_experience, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"influence\" parameter (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in the function call, which was not part of the expected schema, causing the function call not to match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in its function call arguments, which does not match the expected function signature that only requires \"task_name\" and \"priority\" fields. This discrepancy caused the function call not to match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_0", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary parameters (\"session_time\" and \"interactive_elements\") in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the \"locations\" parameter by including nested \"cities\" fields, while the expected function call requires only country-level information for each location without city details. This mismatch caused the function call to be unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the function call wrapped in a non-standard <tool_call> XML tag instead of returning a plain JSON or the required function call format, causing a JSON parsing failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent produced a malformed JSON tool call, likely due to formatting artifacts or an extraneous character, preventing the evaluator from parsing it. The core issue is improper serialization of the function arguments, not a reasoning or tool selection problem."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent included an extra fourth week in the training_schedule parameter instead of the expected three weeks, resulting in a function call argument mismatch that failed to match the required specification."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call arguments, providing only the first name, thus failing to fully utilize the information explicitly requested and provided by the user."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters \"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\" in the function call that are not part of the expected or allowed schema, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and overly detailed protocol information (\"details\" steps) in the function call arguments, producing malformed and unparsable JSON. It should have provided only the requested top-level \"type\" and \"time\" fields for the protocol per the tool schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent output \"pop\" as the genre in lowercase, while the expected function call requires \"Pop\" with an uppercase \"P\". This mismatch prevented an exact parameter match and caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"dataSources\" parameter (\"satellite\") in the function call, which was not part of the expected or defined function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter (\"eventTypes\") in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected CallSignature and causing the evaluator to reject the output. Only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" were allowed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included extra unsupported features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") in the simulation_parameters, resulting in a function call signature that did not match the expected or available tool schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the datetime values for the MindfulSessionScheduler_scheduleYogaStream function call by including the \"Z\" timezone designator, which did not match the expected format without timezone information, leading to a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" key in the correctionPreferences object for each function call, deviating from the required parameter schema and causing a mismatch that prevented correct function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values for both the Eiffel Tower and Colosseum coordinates and did not zero-pad the year for the Colosseum date, resulting in function calls that did not exactly match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent output the function arguments with time values in Zulu (\"Z\")/UTC format (e.g., \"2023-05-28T12:00:00Z\") instead of the required format without the \"Z\" (e.g., \"2023-05-28T12:00:00\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption instead of combining both actions into a single call with both parameter sets as required by the tool's expected usage."}

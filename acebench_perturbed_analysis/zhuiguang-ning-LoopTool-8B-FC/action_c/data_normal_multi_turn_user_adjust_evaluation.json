{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide fully qualified ISO-formatted dates (\"2024-03-08\" and \"2024-03-22\") in its function call, instead using ambiguous formats (\"March 8\" and \"March 22\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent set up only the 'Supervisor' role (with inheritance) but omitted the explicit creation of the 'Admin' and 'User' roles, which were required for a complete and correct role configuration."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed feedbackMethods instead of specifying the feedbackId as \"most-recent\" when calling PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback, failing to reference the correct feedback instance for analysis as requested by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"auditEnabled\": true parameter in its call to securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, omitting an essential argument needed for correct function execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter when calling festival_art_schedule_creator, failing to include the necessary event alert details as specified by the tool, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" parameter (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of using the exact provided phrase (\"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_48_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the SurveyResponseAnalysis_detailedReport function instead of the required SurveyResultsAggregator_collect function, failing to perform the correct aggregation and analysis of response rate and average score as requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", leading to a mismatch with the expected function parameters and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updated communicationModule settings, instead of only changing \"method\" to \"Email\" as requested. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped \"near the Colosseum\" as a special request rather than as the restaurant location, and provided both \"Rome\" and \"near the Colosseum\" as separate fields, leading to a non-matching function signature and failure to meet the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly reported Team Alpha's innovation rate as 65% instead of the correct 70% provided in the input, suggesting it averaged rates instead of reporting individual values as requested, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"finalize and sign the contract\" (lowercase 'f') for the agenda, instead of matching the expected \"Finalize and sign the contract\" (capital 'F'). The evaluator required case-sensitive parameter matching, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter with \"algorithm\": \"demand-driven\" and \"forecasting\": true in its function call, thus failing to specify necessary options for demand-driven, forecast-based deal aggregation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent’s function call included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string, while the expected call required \"breakfast.\" This mismatch in the 'preferences' parameter caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" in the travelDates parameter when calling travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals, specifying only the departureDate instead of both departure and return dates as provided by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance_cost value ($110 instead of the correct $120.5 per person from the insurance options provided earlier), indicating it failed to use the appropriate insurance quote when calculating the travel budget."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter and a nested \"form_title\" field in the manage_feedback_collection call, leading to a mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" as the optionType value instead of the expected \"installments\" in the repaymentOptions objects, resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented correct function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out teams led by non-transformational leaders before calling TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate, incorrectly including Team Gamma (transactional leadership) in the function input instead of restricting it to only transformational leadership teams as required."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields \"existing_conditions\" in traveler_details and \"duration\" in coverage_options when calling travel_budget_manager_get_insurance_options, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters and led to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete—it was missing the final closing curly brace—resulting in a malformed, unparsable output. This truncation caused a failure to pass the required arguments to the function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly altered the wording of the \"desired_qualities\" parameter from \"10 years of industry experience\" to \"at least 10 years of industry experience\", causing a mismatch with the function signature expected by the evaluator. This prevented successful function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"travel_dates\" inside the top-level arguments instead of nesting it within \"user_preferences\" as required by the function schema, resulting in a function call signature mismatch."}

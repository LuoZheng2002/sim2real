{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required exclamation mark at the end of the new password (\"NewSecurePassword123!\"), resulting in a mismatched function call that did not satisfy the expected parameters for resetPassword."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the more specific category \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_5", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted several required profile fields (UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, UserBirthday), supplying instead an unsupported field (UserPreferredContactMethod). This led to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent's loginUser function call omitted the required userPreferredLoginTime (\"Evening\") and loginFrequency (\"Daily\") parameters, and used an incorrect password, failing to include all necessary arguments as expected by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to exactly match the required string \"a town near Austin, TX\" for UserHomeLocation, instead using \"Town near Austin, TX\" (missing the article \"a\"), which caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books\" instead of \"Wellness,\" disregarding the user's implied interest and expected mapping. This parameter mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected output, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_14", "analysis": "The agent's updateUserProfile call omitted \"UserTimeZone\" and \"UserBirthday\" fields required by the expected answer, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call matching. It did not infer or preserve unspecified but necessary profile data."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent used \"Standard\" instead of the user's actual membership status \"Bronze\" in the UserMemberStatus parameter, failing to extract and utilize the correct membership information necessary for an accurate function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a UserSpendingLimit value of 100 instead of the user's actual usual spending limit of 350, failing to retrieve or recognize the correct limit from user data, resulting in an incorrect function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent only provided the updated home location field, omitting all other required user profile fields. The function call was incomplete, lacking parameters like UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly inferred the user's membership status as \"Platinum\" instead of the expected \"Gold,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the ground truth parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent's updateUserProfile call omitted several required fields (UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, UserBirthday) expected by the API, providing only the ones explicitly mentioned by the user. This led to a parameter mismatch and a failure to perform the complete update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the OrderStatus to \"Pending\" instead of updating it to \"Out for Delivery\" as expected; it failed to retrieve or infer the current, more advanced order status before sending the update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Shellfish-Free\" in the UserDietaryPreference argument, which was not expected, leading to a mismatch with the required parameters for updateMenuItem. The function call did not strictly follow the expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters \"UserLoyaltyStatus\" and \"HomeLocation\" in the processPayment function call, failing to fully utilize user profile data needed for applying discounts and meeting the tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the user's password from \"Jessie90#\" to \"Jessie90#new\" instead of preserving the original password, leading to a mismatch in the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required MaxRating parameter in the viewReviews function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature for filtering reviews within the specified rating range."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used \"Indian\" instead of the correct restaurant name \"Indian restaurant\" in the RestaurantName parameter, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model's function call for processPayment used \"OrderName\": \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized), while the expected argument was \"OrderName\": \"dinner order\" (lowercase), causing a mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly supplied \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter, which should be null; this caused the function call to not match the expected input signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the required \"sushi order\" as the OrderName parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call and causing the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set UserDietaryPreferences to [\"Gluten-Free\"] instead of the expected [\"None\"], inferring a dietary preference not provided by the user. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the restaurant name and misinterpreted the dietary preference as \"Vegan\" instead of \"Spicy,\" showing a misunderstanding of both entity resolution and dietary context in the request."}

{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserDietaryPreference parameter to \"Nut-Free\" instead of the correct \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align with the dietary requirement specified in the menu item's name and the user's request."}

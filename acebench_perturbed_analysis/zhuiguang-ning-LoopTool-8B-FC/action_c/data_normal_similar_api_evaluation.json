{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent used paraphrased symptom descriptions (\"crying a lot\" vs \"excessive crying\", \"constant crying\") instead of the standardized/provided terms required by the API, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent fabricated vague or inaccurate details for competitor analysis, customer demographics, and did not match the parameter values expected (e.g., used general statements and wrong demographic data). Thus, the strategy_selector_a call failed strict parameter matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent used \"conflict over AI control\" as the conflict_element argument instead of the specific required value \"AI control,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to exactly match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent ignored integrating the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task according to its \"Urgent\" (likely higher than \"High\") priority and instead rescheduled all tasks including the new one, retaining \"Urgent\" as the priority value instead of normalizing it to \"High.\" Only the new task with adjusted priority should have been scheduled."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call deviated from the required argument values, altering phrases such as \"technology and renewable energy,\" \"having a substantial amount saved,\" and \"maintain some liquidity,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included an extra argument \"include_statistics\": false in the function call to eco_vision_B, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and leading the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the health_tips_b function instead of health_tips_a, and omitted the required \"age\" parameter in the function arguments. It did not follow the established pattern from the prior turn or the expected tool usage."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent repeated the initial, vague problem description instead of providing a deeper, expanded problem description that synthesizes context and includes checks already performed, resulting in an insufficient argument for the clarity_guide_b function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed the target values as a separate array instead of attaching each target to its corresponding data entry; the dataset items should include both \"features\" and \"target\" fields in each dictionary as per the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b as required, and also retained unnecessary evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall) instead of focusing solely on F1 score as requested in the user's latest instruction."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent's function call used the incorrect relation label (\"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\") and added extraneous detail to the status (\"causes tension\"), leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected input and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The model's function call used a different age group format (\"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\") and more verbose status (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of \"not well-known\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"details\" field (with director info) in the function call; only \"title\" and \"year\" were expected. This caused a parameter mismatch, resulting in no match with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The function call made by the agent used the title \"AI Applications in Oncology\" (with uppercase \"A\" and \"I\"), while the expected parameters required the exact string \"AI applications in oncology\" (all lowercase), resulting in a parameter mismatch."}

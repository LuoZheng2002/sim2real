{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"time_range\" restrictions to each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" field, instead of simply specifying the days as required. This resulted in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleIDs, returning \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B,\" leading to a lack of exact match with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"amenities\" field to the search_criteria argument when calling FamilyGatheringVenueFinder, deviating from the tool's expected parameters which should only include location, date_range, and capacity. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false property within the \"privacy\" object in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the specified function signature and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, deviating from the expected schema which only allows \"current_mood\" and \"favorite_genres\" in \"user_preferences\". This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"gear\" information outside the \"hikingDetails\" object in its function call, instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function's expected parameters, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in the tool call (likely missing a closing bracket or comma), causing a parsing error. As a result, the correct update to the white noise settings could not be executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent added an extra period to the address (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call, which resulted in the evaluator failing to recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"releaseYear\" parameter and placed \"themes\" outside the required \"movieDetails\" object, leading to a function call argument structure mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the required parameters, thus failing the strict output comparison."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the same-day penalty as 0.1 (likely representing 10%) instead of the required value of 10, failing to match the expected \"penalty\" field type and value for R123 and R456 cancellations."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, omitting the required analysis for indirect employment. It should have made two separate function calls: one for direct and one for indirect employment impacts, as specified in the user’s request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"winePreferences\" object in its function call arguments, instead of matching the expected API parameters format which does not include \"winePreferences\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function calls as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extra quotation mark after the closing bracket of the \"responseTeams\" array, leading to a parsing error and preventing the tool call from executing correctly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" argument to the content_moderation_analysis function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the tool's expected input schema. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}

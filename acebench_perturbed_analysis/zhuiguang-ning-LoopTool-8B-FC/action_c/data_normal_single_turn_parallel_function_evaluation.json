{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect timestamp formats for the MediaDesignOptimizer_createVisualContent function (included 'T' and seconds), causing a mismatch with the required ISO format ('YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS' vs 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'). It also incorrectly included the audience_reaction field in the fashion_week_trend_analyzer call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to generate all required combinations by omitting predictions for 1 month with Neural Network and 3 months with Random Forest; only two out of the four needed function calls were produced."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_3", "analysis": "The agent set the \"timeFrame\" for both telemed_licenseManager calls to a single day (\"2025-10-09\") instead of the full year (\"2025-01-01\" to \"2025-12-31\") as specified in the user request, leading to parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_7", "analysis": "The model output used the key \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" in its function call objects, causing a schema mismatch, so the evaluator could not identify or match the function calls despite correct data. This is a parameter naming/formatting error."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_8", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for the second tool call (Escher_Shape_Diff_Analyzer) due to a missing closing brace, and it also placed \"analysis_depth\" at the wrong level, omitting it from the individual comparison_pair as required by the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_10", "analysis": "The agent called CulturalTrendAnalyzer_detectTrends with analysisDepth set to \"surface\" instead of the required \"deep,\" failing to match the expected function call parameters and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"severity\" field in the \"weather_conditions\" parameter, which was not expected; the expected output only required \"condition_type\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function calls as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_19", "analysis": "The agent's first tool call output contained malformed JSON—it was missing a closing brace—causing a parsing error. This syntactic mistake prevented successful execution of the \"document_management_store\" function. The tool arguments themselves were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_23", "analysis": "The agent included actual feedback data in the feedbackCollection for MarketingCampaign_manageFeedback, instead of leaving the feedbackData lists empty as expected, indicating a misunderstanding of the required input structure for the report generation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_28", "analysis": "The agent used a hardcoded date range (\"2026-11-01\" to \"2026-11-16\") instead of setting the date range from the start of the year (\"2026-01-01\") to today's date, as requested in the question, for the military_evaluate_threat_levels call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_29", "analysis": "The agent used \"United States\" instead of \"USA\" for the \"country\" parameter in the urban_air_quality_monitor call, causing a mismatch with the expected function arguments and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the packaging material as \"cardboard boxes\" instead of the required \"cardboard,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call arguments for FruitSorter_processSortedFruits."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous \"document_id\" fields within the \"documents\" argument for the insurance_claim_verification function, while the expected format only required \"document_type\", resulting in a mismatch and the evaluator not identifying the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added \"interactions\": true in the details field for each function call, whereas the expected parameters only included \"settlements\" and \"routes\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function calls as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent output an incorrect severity value for \"swelling\" (5 instead of the expected 3) in the ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity function call, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included multiple themes (\"Existentialism\", \"Nihilism\", \"Absurdism\", \"Individualism\") in the findPurposeDrivenFilms call, instead of restricting to only \"Existentialism\" as requested. This made the function call not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent's VisaInformationManager_getVisaRequirements call omitted the required \"documentTypes\" parameter (\"passport\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to retrieve the correct visa requirements."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_42", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"event_details\": [] parameter in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to properly interpret the scenario details: it omitted the \"Car\" prefix in vehicle IDs, provided generic or incorrect infrastructure responses and effectiveness values, and included unnecessary redundant actions instead of specifying only the optimal, context-appropriate response for each vehicle."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"terms\" field in the RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation calls, which was not part of the expected parameters, causing a mismatch with the function signature and thus failure to match the expected function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"terms\" argument in the RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation call and omitted the required \"date\" parameter in RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails, causing its function calls to not match the expected signatures."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in the function calls by omitting a closing brace, causing a parsing failure. Additionally, it did not specify distinct connection identifiers (\"resistor1\", \"resistor2\") for the parallel resistors, leading to ambiguous connections."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent used \"Swimming\" (capitalized) for the 'sport' parameter in olympics_get_top_athletes instead of the expected \"swimming\" (lowercase), causing a parameter mismatch and the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_56", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"caloricLimits\" field with zero values for the corporate event, despite no caloric requirement being specified. This resulted in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call, causing the evaluator not to recognize the output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_65", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"other_elements\": [] field in the initial_composition parameter for both function calls, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema. All required fields must be present, even if empty."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_69", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra details (\"pollution_parameters\" with pollutants and measurement methods) to the ecosystem_impact_assessment call, which did not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"intensity\" parameter for the reverb effect to 0.9 instead of the expected value of 1, and it included the unsupported \"apply_time\" parameter, causing the function call not to match the required specification."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_81", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in both function calls, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signatures for AudioConfigurator_optimizeSound and DiskTemperatureControl_adjustCoolingSystem. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function calls as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_84", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"settings\" argument for HomeLightingControl_manageLightSettings as a list instead of an object, causing a schema mismatch and preventing the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_85", "analysis": "The model incorrectly structured the reason.details field as an object with scenario and examples keys, instead of as a list containing a single object with only the scenario property. This led to a function call argument mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_87", "analysis": "The model used capitalized values (\"Swimming\" instead of \"swimming\") for the 'sport' parameter in its function calls, causing them not to match the expected format and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_88", "analysis": "The agent omitted \"includeEvents: false\" in the Colosseum call; this caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters, as the API likely requires explicit inclusion of all parameters rather than relying on defaults."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_99", "analysis": "The agent used lowercase \"property division\" for disputeNature instead of the expected capitalized \"Property division,\" causing a strict parameter mismatch for the InheritanceMediationScheduler_scheduleSession function call.

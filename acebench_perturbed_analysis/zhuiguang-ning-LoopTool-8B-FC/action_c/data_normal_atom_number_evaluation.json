{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"analysisDepth\") in its function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, resulting in a non-matching call. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" are valid according to the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_23", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"focusArea\" parameter to the TeamEfficiencyAnalyzer function call, which does not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject it as a valid call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"minRating\": 4 parameter when calling LocalFoodDeliverySearch, failing to restrict results to highly-rated options as specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for \"serviceSectorGrowth\" (0.8 instead of 5.6) and \"foreignInvestment\" (500 instead of 900), failing to match the expected parameters. This indicates a failure to extract or recall the correct contextual data required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 5 instead of the expected 1200, failing to capture or infer the actual message delay reported or required for proper diagnosis. This mismatch led to an unrecognized function call by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to use the specialized tool designed for persistent vein visibility and associated symptoms as described in the user's query."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent supplied overly literal and unprocessed user inputs as function arguments rather than abstracting and normalizing data as expected (e.g., demographics and evaluation criteria), resulting in mismatched function call parameters that failed to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the conflict element as \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected \"AI control,\" causing a parameter mismatch and failure to produce the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly scheduled all four tasks together instead of scheduling only the newly requested \"Prepare Presentation\" task, and did not update the priority from \"Urgent\" to \"High\" as was expected by the function call requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent included the word \"sectors\" in the \"investment_preferences\" argument, differing from the expected string. This mismatch in argument values led to failure to match the function call per the strict evaluator, despite all other fields being correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the required \"medium\" for body_type in the function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a, and omitted the required \"age\" parameter present in the ground truth, leading to a mismatch with the expected function and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to clarity_guide_b used an insufficiently detailed problem_description, failing to incorporate all contextual information provided by the user (recent troubleshooting steps and request for diverse perspectives), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call to model_optimizer_y by providing the target values as a separate list instead of integrating each target with its corresponding dataset entry as required by the expected function schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b as required, and also used a different format for preprocess_rules. It failed to use the correct function specified by the tools for identifying user buying tendencies."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent output the relation as \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker,\" resulting in a mismatch with the function's expected parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments did not exactly match the expected parameters: it used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group and \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of the concise \"not well-known,\" leading to a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the title (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") instead of matching the expected lowercase format (\"AI applications in oncology\"), causing a strict mismatch with the evaluator's expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added specific time ranges (\"09:00-17:00\") for weekdays in the time_restrictions, instead of just specifying the days as required. This resulted in a mismatch with the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct \"sampleID\" values by omitting the \"Sample\" prefix and using \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B,\" leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field within the privacy settings when calling ConferenceSessionManager_createSession, resulting in a function call that did not fully match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the \"contentData\" parameter as a list of article objects, rather than as an object containing both an \"articles\" array and \"userPreferences\" as required by the function schema. This caused the function call to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used country names (\"Vietnam,\" \"UK,\" \"Spain\") instead of cultural backgrounds (\"Vietnamese,\" \"British,\" \"Spanish\") for participants, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to meet the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's function call output contained malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace at the end, causing a parsing error and preventing successful invocation of the tool despite otherwise correct argument structuring."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent produced an invalid JSON tool call, likely due to an unescaped or missing character, causing parsing to fail. This prevented the tool call from being executed despite having the correct parameters semantically."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included a period after \"123 Main St.\" in the \"location\" parameter, whereas the expected value was \"123 Main St\" without the period. This minor formatting mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent provided \"themes\" as a separate argument at the top level alongside \"movieDetails\", instead of embedding the \"themes\" list inside the \"movieDetails\" object as required by the function signature. This caused a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"settings\" field (as an empty object) in the summary widget for the second dashboard, making its function call arguments not match the expected structure. This structural discrepancy led to function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent output incorrectly formatted JSON (using 0.1 instead of 10 for same-day penalty and omitting closing braces), leading to a parsing failure. It also used a decimal where an integer value (penalty 10) was expected per the cancellation policy."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a separate function call for indirect employment, as explicitly requested in the question. Both direct and indirect analysis were required, but only one call was made."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for the tool call by including an extraneous closing quote after the responseTeams array, resulting in invalid syntax and causing failure to parse the function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected input schema and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call as valid."}

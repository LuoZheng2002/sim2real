{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call arguments, providing only the first name, resulting in an incomplete and mismatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent included non-existent parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery function call, which do not match the tool's expected schema and caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call, which is not part of the tool schema. This caused the function call to not match the expected parameters, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"schedule\" parameter specifying daily runs at 6:00 AM in the function call, thus not fulfilling the scheduling aspect of the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The model output the genre as \"pop\" (lowercase), but the expected parameter is \"Pop\" (capitalized). This mismatch prevented an exact match with the expected function call signature, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported extra features (\"features\" list) to the simulation_parameters in its function call, deviating from the required parameter schema. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature, resulting in a failed tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect coordinate values for longitude and failed to correctly format the ancient date (\"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\"), resulting in function call mismatches with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters into a single call to WebSecurity_EncryptionManager as required by the function schema."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required new password (\"NewSecurePassword123!\") by omitting the exclamation mark, resulting in a parameter mismatch for the resetPassword function call. This deviation caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The model outputted \"Sports\" instead of the correct category \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing the function call not to match the expected output and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted required parameters \"userPreferredLoginTime\" and \"loginFrequency,\" and used an incorrect password. It also failed to capture and include the user's preferred login time as instructed, resulting in incomplete fulfillment of the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to exactly match the expected \"UserHomeLocation\" string (\"a town near Austin, TX\") by omitting the initial \"a\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Sports\" instead of \"Wellness\" as expected, failing to align with the user's established category preference in the world state. This mismatch caused the function call to be considered non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_preference_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to include all known user profile fields—specifically \"UserTimeZone\" and \"UserBirthday\"—in its updateUserProfile call, even though this information was available and required for a complete update according to the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Platinum\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the user's actual status, \"Bronze\", leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to call the function with the expected arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserSpendingLimit parameter to 100 instead of the actual user limit of 350, disregarding either context or previous user settings, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile with only the updated home location, omitting required user fields such as name, email, language, timezone, and birthday, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter when calling calculateShippingCost, omitting necessary user context that may affect the shipping cost calculation. This led to a function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile but supplied only UserEmail and UserHomeLocation, omitting required fields (UserName, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday), resulting in a function call that doesn't match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the OrderStatus to \"Pending\" instead of updating it to the appropriate status (\"Out for Delivery\"), failing to reflect the real-time order progress as required by the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences (\"Gluten-Free, Shellfish-Free\") into a single string for the \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter instead of only using \"Gluten-Free\" as required by the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters UserLoyaltyStatus and HomeLocation when calling processPayment, failing to fully utilize user profile information as implied by the task and expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated the user's password to \"Jessie90#new\" instead of retaining the correct value \"Jessie90#\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters for updateUserProfile."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, failing to include all necessary arguments as expected by the tool's interface. This led to a mismatch and the evaluator could not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used \"Indian\" instead of the required full restaurant name \"Indian restaurant\" for the RestaurantName parameter, resulting in a parameter value mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameters \"UserLoyaltyStatus\" and \"HomeLocation\" when calling processPayment, failing to incorporate the user's loyalty status and residential location as specified by the task requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter instead of leaving it null, leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly inferred the user's dietary preference as \"Gluten-Free\" instead of using the correct value \"None.\" This led to a mismatched function call argument and caused the failure. The agent should not make unstated assumptions about dietary preferences."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly substituted the restaurant name (\"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\") and misrepresented the user's dietary preference as \"Vegan\" instead of the implied \"Spicy\", leading to a function call that didn't match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"Amount\" parameter and incorrectly set \"UserRefundPreference\" to \"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\" as expected. This indicates it failed to determine and include both the refund amount and the correct user preference."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of \"Low Sodium,\" failing to align the dietary preference with the menu item's intent and the user's stated needs. This mismatch led to the function call not matching the expected parameters."}

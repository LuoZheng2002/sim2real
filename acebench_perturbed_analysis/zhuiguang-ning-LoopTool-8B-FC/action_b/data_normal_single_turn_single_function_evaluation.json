{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"eclipseType\": \"total\" parameter in the function call, resulting in an incomplete request that does not specify the user's focus on total solar eclipses as instructed in the original question."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly listed the beneficiaries' relationships as “Grandson” and “Daughter” instead of normalizing both as “grandchild” as required by the function. This mismatch in parameter values caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent outputted the time_frame values with full timestamps (including time and \"Z\") instead of the expected \"YYYY-MM-DD\" date-only format, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"sourceId\": \"1\" in the dataSources parameter, instead using \"API\", which does not match the expected structure and causes a mismatch with the tool's function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent formatted the timeRange parameter values with a \"Z\" (Zulu/UTC indicator) and set the end time to \"2024-02-15T23:59:59Z\" instead of matching the expected \"2024-02-15T00:00:00\" format, causing a mismatch with the required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for related actions that should have been combined into a single call, passing both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters together as required by the tool's expected input structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The model used a parameter key \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters\" for the function call, leading to a mismatch that caused the evaluator to not recognize the function invocation despite the content being correct otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This missing argument caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required classificationPeriod parameter and altered the feature naming (\"distinctive long beak\" instead of \"long beak\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data argument and used the incomplete location \"123 Market St\" instead of \"123 Market St, San Francisco\", causing the function call parameters to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in parameter naming: the agent used \"arguments\" instead of the required \"parameters\" for the function call, resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the invocation despite otherwise correct tool and argument selection."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only included one digital display instead of the required two, and the display content did not match exactly (\"our latest product video\" vs. \"latest product video\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included additional preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") not specified by the user, rather than limiting the childProfile preferences to only \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as instructed in the original question."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_53", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped \"creditHistoryProviders\" and \"analysisPeriod\" inside \"userData\" instead of passing them as top-level parameters, resulting in a malformed JSON structure that caused a parsing error and failed tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent output \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of \"green tea leaves\" as the ingredient, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in a failure to match the expected structured call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_58", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Wednesday\" as an available weekday in the schedule, despite the user specifying unavailability on Wednesdays. This led to a mismatch between the expected and actual function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"readingLevel\" field in the \"userProfile\" argument, causing the function call to not exactly match the required specification and leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The model used float values (0.0, 5.0) for costAdjustment instead of the expected integers (0, 5), leading to a mismatch with the required function call signature and thus no match being found."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The model output the function call in a <tool_call> tag with JSON, rather than using the required structured function call format expected by the environment, leading to a mismatch and evaluator error despite correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"timeWindow\" field's \"start\" and \"end\" values using the ISO 8601 format with a \"Z\" suffix for UTC (\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\"), while the expected format omits the \"Z\" and has seconds as \"00\" (no \"Z\" and no seconds for \"end\"). This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Great Wall Beijing Segment\" instead of the required \"Great Wall Beijing\" for the siteId parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent failed to properly close the JSON object in the tool call, resulting in invalid JSON syntax. This caused the tool call to be unparsable, despite otherwise providing the correct parameters and structure."}

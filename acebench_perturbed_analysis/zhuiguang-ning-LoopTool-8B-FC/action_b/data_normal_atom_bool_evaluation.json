{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument (\"include_legal_requirements\") to the ExportRegulationAdvisor function call, which does not match the required parameters, resulting in no valid function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required work_focus parameter in its function call and formatted leisure_activities as an array instead of a comma-separated string, causing the call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_11", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"include_diy_solutions\": true parameter in its RefrigeratorNoiseDiagnosis function call, omitting the request for suggested solutions, which was explicitly warranted by the user's question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted required parameters \"include_attachment\" and \"encryption_level,\" resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input schema. It failed to specify security options for sending confidential information."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_19", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"include_graphical_analysis\") in the function call, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected schema for TaxPolicyImpactSimulator, which should only include \"simulation_scenario\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the extra argument \"include_weekend_rules\": true to the DailyTrafficRuleNotifier function call, which is not expected or supported by the function's required parameters. Only the \"area_code\" parameter should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, and include_device_usage to true, whereas the expected output required all these parameters to be set to false. The agent failed to align optional analysis flags with the default/expected values."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_38", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous parameters (\"include_population_estimates\" and \"data_format\") in the OceanicBiodiversityData_fetch function call, which are not supported by the tool's defined schema; only \"zone_identifier\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameter \"include_indoor_suggestions\" in its WeekendWeatherChecker function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"technology startup\" instead of \"technology\" for the \"industry\" parameter, failing to match the function's expected input and resulting in no matching function call."}

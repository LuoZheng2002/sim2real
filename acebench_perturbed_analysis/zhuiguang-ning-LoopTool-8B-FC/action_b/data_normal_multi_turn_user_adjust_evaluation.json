{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide fully-qualified date values (missing the year \"2024\") for the \"startDate\" and \"endDate\" parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format and failure to trigger the tool correctly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"feedbackId\": \"most-recent\" parameter in the function call, resulting in an incomplete invocation that did not meet the expected input criteria."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required 'Admin' and 'User' roles in the securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles call, returning only the new 'Supervisor' role. All specified roles should have been set up together as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function to set up user roles instead of the required configureAccessControl function, failing to define the necessary permissions and audit settings as specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (with enableAlerts and alertTime) when calling the festival_art_schedule_creator function, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_48_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called SurveyResponseAnalysis_detailedReport instead of SurveyResultsAggregator_collect, failing to aggregate requested metrics (response rate, average score) as specified by the user. It did not use the correct function matching the analysis request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" field (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the expected value \"ensure compliance\", leading to a mismatch in function call parameters and failure to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the special_requests field and left the location as \"Rome\" instead of setting the location parameter to \"near the Colosseum\" as required by the function's expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and caused the evaluator to reject it."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updated communicationModule settings when only the \"method\": \"Email\" should have been changed, resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected modification format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent generated the report using an incorrect innovation rate for Team Alpha (65% instead of the correct 70% provided in the input), indicating it used an average or previously summarized value instead of the actual team-specific data required by the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call matches all parameter values correctly, but the \"agenda\" string does not capitalize \"Finalize,\" causing a strict string mismatch with the expected output which required case sensitivity. This minor formatting issue prevented the match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter with demand-driven algorithm and forecasting, which is necessary for this tool according to the expected answer. This led to a mismatch with the evaluator's requirement."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string instead of using the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast,\" causing a mismatch with the exact parameters required for the function call. This subtle wording difference prevented proper matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" (\"2024-01-03\") in the travelDates parameter when calling travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the user's specified round-trip request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance_cost value ($110 instead of the quoted $120.5 per person) when calling travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget, indicating it failed to select the most relevant or accurate insurance price based on the prior system-provided options."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" field in the manage_feedback_collection call, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the team with a transactional leader and included it in the function call, contrary to the tool description which specifies only transformational leadership teams should be analyzed for innovation rate."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" instead of the expected \"installments\" for the repayment option type in the function call, causing a mismatch with the required function schema and resulting in the function call being unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"existing_conditions\" field in each traveler's details and did not include the \"duration\" option in coverage_options, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call contained a JSON syntax error—a stray quotation mark in a numeric value—making the output unparsable. This prevented execution of the required function despite correct intent and structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call had malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace at the end, causing a parsing failure. This indicates a syntactic error in generating the tool call output format, not an issue with content or reasoning."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent modified the \"desired_qualities\" field by paraphrasing it as \"at least 10 years of industry experience\" instead of directly using the user's original phrase \"10 years of industry experience\"; this prevented a match with the expected function call, which required an exact string match."}

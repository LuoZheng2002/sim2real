{"id": "normal_atom_enum_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"investmentHorizon\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the available tool's specification, resulting in a mismatch and failure to call the function as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"contactMethod\": \"Email\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure. This prevented the evaluator from matching the output to the correct function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"outputDetail\" parameter with the value \"Summary,\" resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This missing parameter caused the evaluator to reject the agent's output as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_24", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetailLevel\": \"Detailed\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature and failure to fully specify the necessary output detail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_34", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"eventType\": \"Concert\" parameter in its function call, omitting the user's explicit request to find a concert rather than any event, which resulted in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter in the function call, failing to filter recommendations by rating quality as requested in the user's query."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_43", "analysis": "The agent used the verbose form \"Eastern Standard Time\" instead of the required \"EST\" abbreviation for the timezone parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format."}

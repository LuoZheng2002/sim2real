{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"include_legal_requirements\") in its ExportRegulationAdvisor function call, resulting in a schema mismatch and no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator. Only \"export_category\" should have been used."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"work_focus\" parameter in its function call to TimeManagementAssistant_designSchedule and formatted \"leisure_activities\" as a list instead of the expected comma-separated string, resulting in no valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_11", "analysis": "The agent unnecessarily changed the noise_level parameter value from \"loud rattling\" to \"loud rattling noise,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema and resulting in evaluator failure to match outputs."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted required parameters (\"include_attachment\" and \"encryption_level\"), resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected usage."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, and include_device_usage to true instead of false, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters and therefore failed validation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required include_indoor_suggestions parameter in its WeekendWeatherChecker function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to fail to recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent used an invalid parameter value \"technology startup\" for the \"industry\" field instead of the expected \"technology\", causing the function call not to match the expected schema. This mismatch prevented successful evaluation."}

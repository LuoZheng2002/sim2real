{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"analysisDepth\": 5) in its function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, causing a mismatch with the available tool signature that only accepts \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_15", "analysis": "The agent's function call to GalaxyVisualizationGenerator omitted the required \"visualizationType\": \"3D model\" parameter, resulting in a non-matching call format and thus the failure to satisfy the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"minRating\": 4 parameter in its LocalFoodDeliverySearch function call, failing to filter for highly-rated options as requested in the user's query."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set serviceSectorGrowth and foreignInvestment to 0 instead of using the correct provided or expected values (5.6 and 900), indicating a failure to extract or utilize relevant data from the context or knowledge base."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_33", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required parameter \"characterName\": \"Itachi Uchiha\" in the GetCharacterBackground function call, which is necessary to fetch the specific character's background. Only animeId and includeSpoilers were provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 5 instead of the expected 1200, failing to use the correct message delay value provided or inferred from the context, which led to the function call not matching the benchmark's requirements."}

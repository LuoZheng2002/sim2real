{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500 for each month, causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in no matching function call being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"Paris, France\" instead of \"Paris\" for the \"location\" parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct. The root issue is invalid argument formatting for the \"location\" parameter."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"translationFeatures\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected schema. As a result, the evaluator could not find a matching function call, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId and included non-empty \"mustSeeExhibits,\" deviating from the expected empty list. These parameter mismatches caused the function call to not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent called CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments but included an extra, unsupported parameter (\"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\") not expected by the tool schema, resulting in a function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in its function call to TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This missing field caused the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified color preferences (primary: green, secondary: blue) and instead used incorrect color codes (#FF5733 and #33D4FF) in its logo_design_create function call, failing to follow explicit user instructions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent called \"BankruptcyFilingProcessor_processFiling\" but the correct tool name available was \"BankruptcyFilingProcessor_processFiling_1\"; the function name mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the call, resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"targetGroup\": \"finance department\" parameter in the function call, omitting the specification of the survey's intended respondents as requested in the task."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"influence\" argument in its function call to \"cultural_event_classical_music_impact,\" which caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and led to the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included city-level details (\"Berlin\" and \"Paris\") in the \"locations\" argument instead of only the country names (\"Germany\", \"France\") as required by the function schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no successful function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted weeks 2 and 3 from the training_schedule in its function call, only including week 1. The expected function call required a 3-week training schedule, resulting in a mismatch with the benchmark's expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output malformed JSON for the tool call (e.g., extra or missing characters or improper structure), causing parsing failure. The agent should ensure strict adherence to valid JSON syntax when formatting function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent output valid function call content, but it was incorrectly wrapped inside an invalid <tool_call> XML-style tag, causing JSON parsing to fail; it should have output pure JSON or used the expected function call schema directly."}

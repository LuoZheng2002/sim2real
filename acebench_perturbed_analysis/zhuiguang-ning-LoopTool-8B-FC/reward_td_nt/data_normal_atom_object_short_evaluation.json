{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call, providing only the first name (\"Helena\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters required by the function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra, unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the function call, causing it not to match the expected tool signature and resulting in evaluator rejection. Only the required parameters should have been used."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call to artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"schedule\" parameter with the specified time and frequency for daily test execution at 6:00 AM, omitting a key aspect of the user's request in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent attempted to call MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks, but did not disambiguate between the two available versions (MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks and MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks_1). The benchmark expected the fully qualified tool name, so the call was not matched."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"features\" field in the function call arguments, which did not match the expected schema for stellar_evolution_simulator, causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unnecessary parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") in its function calls that were not part of the function signature, causing a mismatch and preventing correct invocation of technews_fetch_latest_ai_developments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values for both locations (Eiffel Tower and Colosseum) and failed to zero-pad the Colosseum date year (\"100\" instead of \"0100\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call arguments."}

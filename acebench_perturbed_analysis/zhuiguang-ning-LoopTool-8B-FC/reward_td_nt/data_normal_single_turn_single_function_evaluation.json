{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly labeled the beneficiaries' relationships as \"Grandson\" and \"Daughter\" instead of generalizing both as \"grandchild\" as required; additionally, it used capitalized beneficiary names (\"User\", \"Sister\") rather than the expected lower-case (\"user\", \"sister\"), causing the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the date values in the time_frame as ISO 8601 datetime strings with times and timezone (\"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z\") instead of plain dates (\"2023-05-01\") as required by the function signature, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent generated a function call using \"sourceId\": \"API\" instead of the required \"sourceId\": \"1\", failing to match the expected dataSources structure and preventing the tool invocation from being recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included a \"Z\" timezone designator in the timeRange values, but the expected parameters required no timezone information; this mismatch led to a failure to match the function call signature exactly."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent called travelAdDesigner_createCampaign, but provided arguments under an incorrect key (\"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in no recognized function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The model failed to match the expected function call format, likely due to capitalizing device names (\"Smartphone\", \"Laptop\") instead of using the required lowercase (\"smartphone\", \"laptop\"), leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in its AccountManager_verifyDocument function call, resulting in a signature mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in its function call and incorrectly paraphrased the feature as \"distinctive long beak\" instead of the expected \"long beak,\" resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"historical\": false field in traffic_data and failed to include \"San Francisco\" in the store location, resulting in function arguments that do not match the expected parameters for the store_setup_manager call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function name but failed to match the required parameter key names exactly; it used \"imageData\" and other casing variations, resulting in no exact match with the expected function call syntax."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent failed to include two digital displays as required, providing only one in the branding.digitalDisplays array. Additionally, the tool name matched an available tool, so the primary error is an incorrect number of displays, not a naming issue."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent included extra preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") in the childProfile that were not mentioned by the user, deviating from the specified interests, leading to a function call argument mismatch and evaluator failure to recognize the function invocation as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_53", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its tool call, omitting a closing brace and using \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters\" field, resulting in a parsing failure and a mismatch with the required tool input schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent output \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" for the ingredients list, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and causing the function call to not be recognized as correct."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent omitted the installationDate for the kitchen sensor (\"001\"), resulting in an incomplete function call that failed to match the expected parameters for homeEcoTest_airQualityMonitoring. This missing detail caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent output non-integer values (0.0 and 5.0) for costAdjustment instead of the expected integers (0 and 5), causing a stricter evaluation to reject the function call due to a type mismatch in the arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent submitted the correct function, parameters, and values, but formatted the function call as a tool_call block instead of the allowed parameterized list format, causing an evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent's function call included timestamps with a \"Z\" suffix (indicating UTC time) and seconds, while the expected parameters required a format without \"Z\" and without seconds, leading to a mismatch in function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"timeFrame\" parameter not required by the function signature, causing a mismatch with the expected function call for ConversationManager_linkMessages. Only the specified parameters should have been included."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent generated the correct function name and arguments, but used a password value (\"NewSecurePassword123\") that did not exactly match the expected value (\"NewSecurePassword123!\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing the function call not to match the expected schema and fail the evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameters \"userPreferredLoginTime\" and \"loginFrequency\" in the loginUser function call, providing only \"email\" and an incorrect \"password\", thus failing to fulfill the full login requirements from the user prompt."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required article \"a\" in the \"UserHomeLocation\" parameter (\"Town near Austin, TX\" instead of \"a town near Austin, TX\"), causing a mismatch in the function call arguments expected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books\" instead of \"Wellness,\" failing to use the category reflecting the user's actual preferences as required by the task, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_14", "analysis": "The agent omitted key profile fields—UserTimeZone and UserBirthday—in the updateUserProfile call, failing to preserve other user attributes from the original profile, as required for a complete update. Only explicitly requested fields were changed, leading to an incomplete profile update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Platinum\" as the UserMemberStatus instead of \"Bronze,\" not reflecting the actual user status. This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserSpendingLimit parameter to 100 instead of the user's actual limit of 350, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters and causing the evaluator to reject it."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called updateUserProfile instead of updateUserProfile_1, but the tool spec includes two separate functions; it should have matched the exact available function name to ensure correct API invocation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter to the calculateShippingCost function call, which does not match any available function signature, causing the function call to fail."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent omitted required profile fields (UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, UserBirthday) in the updateUserProfile call, failing to supply a complete parameter set as expected for a valid profile update action."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent sent the order update with an incorrect OrderStatus (\"Pending\" instead of the required \"Out for Delivery\"), failing to reflect the accurate status as expected in the task."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included two dietary preferences in the UserDietaryPreference field instead of only \"Gluten-Free\" as expected, resulting in a function call that did not match the benchmark's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent's function call to processPayment omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus failing to execute the payment as specified."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect new password (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of \"Jessie90#\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and thus no match for the required updateUserProfile function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment call, and used \"OrderName\" capitalization differing from expected; this led to an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used \"Indian\" instead of the correct restaurant name \"Indian restaurant\" in the RestaurantName field, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent specified \"OrderName\" as \"Dinner Order\" (capitalized), whereas the expected input was \"dinner order\" (lowercase). This case mismatch caused the function call not to match exactly, leading to the evaluator error."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an imprecise restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" in the function arguments instead of leaving it null as expected, causing no match with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" for OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Gluten-Free\" in UserDietaryPreferences instead of the expected [\"None\"] as per the ground truth. This mismatch in the function call arguments caused the evaluator to reject the output as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" as the restaurant name instead of \"My favorite Korean joint,\" and specified \"Vegan\" for UserDietaryPreference instead of the expected \"Spicy,\" leading to a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent's function call to processRefund omitted the required \"Amount\" parameter and incorrectly used the \"UserRefundPreference\" value as \"Original Method\" instead of the expected \"Store Credit,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Nut-Free\" instead of the user's implicit \"Low Sodium\" preference based on the menu item name. It failed to extract and use the correct dietary preference as required by the prompt."}

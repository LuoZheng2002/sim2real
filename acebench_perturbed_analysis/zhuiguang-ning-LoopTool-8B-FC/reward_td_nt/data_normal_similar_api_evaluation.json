{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent used paraphrased symptom descriptions (\"crying a lot\" instead of \"excessive crying\" and \"constant crying\") rather than the expected terms, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict string comparison methodology."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent provided incorrect and incomplete parameter values to the strategy_selector_a function—using vague placeholders and inconsistent data formats—instead of extracting and transforming user-provided details to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the word \"conflict\" to the value of the \"conflict_element\" parameter (\"conflict over AI control\") instead of using the expected value \"AI control,\" causing a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent failed to update the \"priority\" of \"Prepare Presentation\" from \"Urgent\" (as given by the user) to \"High\" (as expected by the function parameters/spec), leading to a non-matching function call signature for task_schedule_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments do not exactly match the available tool signature—specifically, it uses \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy,\" and its short-term goal description deviates from the expected phrasing, causing an argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool name and arguments format, but it output the parameter \"body_type\" as \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium,\" causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of the required health_tips_a function and omitted the necessary \"age\" parameter, failing to match the expected function call and parameter set specified by the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent’s function call lacks the detailed and diversified “problem_description” required by the tool, simply restating the initial brief description instead of synthesizing new details and perspectives mentioned or implied in the previous system message and user request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, which was the correct and faster function for this follow-up request. It also incorrectly structured the preprocess_rules argument and included unnecessary evaluation metrics rather than just the F1 score."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name \"motivate_social_b\" and provided appropriate arguments, but there was a mismatch in the argument value \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker,\" causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent's function call used slightly different parameter values (\"25 to 35\" vs \"25-35\", more verbose brand status), causing a mismatch with the expected function call, which required exact string and formatting matches for arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct tool name \"med_aiArticleGen\", but failed to include the required \"parameters\" nesting in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected format."}

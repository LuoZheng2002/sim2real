{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide full ISO 8601 formatting for the date values in the function call arguments (\"March 8\" instead of \"2024-03-08\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function name (PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1 instead of PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback) and failed to include required parameters (employeeId and feedbackId), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only set up the 'Supervisor' role inheriting from 'Admin' but neglected to include the previously established 'Admin' and 'User' roles in the user roles setup, resulting in an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles to define the roles, instead of securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, which is required to assign specific permissions to roles and enable auditing as requested. It failed to address access control configuration."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (including enableAlerts and alertTime) in its function call to festival_art_schedule_creator, resulting in an incomplete call that did not match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary \"to\" at the start of the reviewReason parameter (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), causing the function call to not match the expected parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field under the updated \"communicationModule\" settings in its TechManager_modifyDeployment call, whereas the correct call should have only updated \"method\" to \"Email\" and omitted \"frequency\" entirely."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"near the Colosseum\" as the \"special_requests\" field instead of specifying it as the \"location\" parameter, and did not omit this field as required. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called schedule_meeting instead of the required schedule_meeting_1 function, despite both being available. This mismatch in function name caused the evaluator to reject the function call, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_ids (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\" instead of \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\") in its function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and leading to evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"parameters\" key in the function call payload and instead placed the \"teamReports\" array at the root, resulting in a mismatched function call format and failure to match the expected API signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the \"preferences\" field instead of matching the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast.\" This minor discrepancy in argument phrasing led to a strict mismatch, causing the function call not to be recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent called travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals without including the required pricingOptions parameter (with algorithm and forecasting details), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the insurance_cost parameter ($110 instead of the correct $120.5 from the provided insurance options) when calling travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" in the travelDates parameter for the flight search, providing only the \"departureDate\", even though the user specified a round trip (\"December 30th to January 3rd\"). This led to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra top-level parameter \"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\" in its function call, which was not expected. This caused the evaluator to reject the output as a non-matching function call despite correct form fields and schedule."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the team led by a transactional leader before calling TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate, resulting in an incorrect function call that included non-transformational teams against tool requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"existing_conditions\" field in \"traveler_details\" and did not include the required \"duration\" field in \"coverage_options,\" leading to a function call that did not precisely match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent called financeManager_manageDebt with \"monthly installments\" as optionType instead of the required \"installments,\" resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to match the expected call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its function call, specifically an extra quotation mark after the last numeric trait scores. This syntax error prevented successful parsing and execution of the intended tool action."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete, missing the final closing brace, resulting in a JSON parsing error. This truncation likely came from hitting a token or length limit without proper completion."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent inserted \"at least\" into the \"desired_qualities\" field instead of exactly matching \"10 years of industry experience\" as required, causing the function call parameters to differ from the expected canonical form and failing to match."}

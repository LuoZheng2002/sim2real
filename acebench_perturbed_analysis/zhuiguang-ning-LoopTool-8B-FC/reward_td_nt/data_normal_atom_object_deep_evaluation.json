{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"time_range\" values to the \"time_restrictions\" for each weekday, instead of specifying only the days as required. This extra detail caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper object in the function parameters and did not use the full sample IDs (\"Sample A\", \"Sample B\") as specified, resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field in the \"privacy\" object and provided the \"startTime\" with a 'Z' timezone designator, differing from the expected format, leading to the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to wrap the articles and userPreferences under a single \"contentData\" object with an \"articles\" key, instead passing a list and userPreferences separately. This led to a parameter structure mismatch with the expected function input format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete or malformed, likely missing a closing brace or bracket, resulting in a parsing error. It failed to output syntactically valid JSON for the function call despite having otherwise correct structure and content."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent responded with a tool call using invalid JSON syntax, causing parsing failure. Specifically, the trailing characters outside the JSON structure (likely XML-like tags) led to the error, rather than an error in core decision-making or tool selection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included a period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\") instead of matching the expected \"123 Main St\", causing the function call arguments to not match exactly and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"themes\" parameter inside the \"movieDetails\" object instead of at the root level, resulting in a function call signature mismatch with the available tool's expected input structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field in the second dashboard's widget, resulting in an argument structure mismatch with the expected function call schema. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the model's function call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON due to missing closing braces, and also incorrectly set the \"penalty\" for same-day cancellations as 0.1 instead of the specified value of 10, misinterpreting the penalty's units or format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a separate function call for indirect employment, as requested. It should have issued two function calls: one for direct and one for indirect employment impacts."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unused \"winePreferences\" argument in its function call, causing its output to not exactly match any valid tool signature; strict parameter matching failed, even though the core information was correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extraneous closing quote after the responseTeams array, resulting in a syntax error and preventing the function call from being correctly parsed and executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" to the function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching."}

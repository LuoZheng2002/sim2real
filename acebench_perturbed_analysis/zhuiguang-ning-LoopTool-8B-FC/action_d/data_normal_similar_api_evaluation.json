{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to recognize the need for a medical recommendation given persistent symptoms and associated behaviors as described in the user query."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected parameter schema: it omitted detailed competitor analysis, provided incorrect or extraneous customer demographics, and used different naming and values for evaluation criteria fields than expected, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"conflict over AI control\" instead of matching the expected \"conflict_element\": \"AI control\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly scheduled all four tasks together, instead of adding only the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task as a separate call, and it failed to map the \"Urgent\" priority to the expected \"High\" priority for the new task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent used the parameter name \"exact_match\" instead of the expected \"range_lookup\" in the vlookup_step_guide function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"investment_preferences\" as a list instead of the required string, and paraphrased \"financial_status\" and goals, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters, leading to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to clarity_guide_b used a generic and insufficient problem description instead of reusing or expanding upon the clarified, detailed description established earlier in the conversation, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b as required. Additionally, it formatted preprocess_rules as an object instead of the expected list, and included extra evaluation metrics instead of only \"F1 score\" as specified in the follow-up request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker,\" and included extra information (\"causes tension\") in the \"status\" field. These deviations caused the output to not match the expected call signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required \"target_market\" age_group format (\"25-35\" as a string), instead outputting the integer 25. It also added unnecessary detail (\"fairly new and currently not well-known\") for \"current_brand_status\" instead of using the expected concise string \"not well-known\"."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"details\" field with the director in the function call arguments, instead of providing only the required \"title\" and \"year\" fields as expected by the movie_summary_a function."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent unnecessarily capitalized the title argument (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" instead of \"AI applications in oncology\"), causing an exact parameter mismatch with the expected function call. This minor formatting difference led to evaluation failure."}

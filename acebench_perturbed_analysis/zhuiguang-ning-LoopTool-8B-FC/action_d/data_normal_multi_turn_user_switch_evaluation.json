{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter with \"keyLength\" to the DataGuard_encryptBusinessData function call, which does not match the tool schema, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent generated an incorrect expense amount for \"Utilities\" ($50 instead of the requested $500), indicating a misreading or misprocessing of the user's instruction for the utilities expense, resulting in an invalid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter required by the function call schema, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected arguments and thus failed to be recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included the country (\"Paris, France\") instead of just the city (\"Paris\") in the location parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call that required only the city name."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included extra optional parameters (\"translationFeatures\" with idiomaticExpressions, culturalInsights, and pronunciationAdjustments) in its function call, which did not match the expected function signature that only requires sourceLanguage, targetLanguage, content, and contentType."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in its function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter and inappropriately included a non-empty mustSeeExhibits list, which was not provided or requested by the user, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"analysisDepth\" parameter (\"deep\") in the function call, which does not match the expected or supported parameters for CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments, leading to an invalid function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The model omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in its function call to TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. All specified parameters, including \"timeOfDay,\" were necessary for task completion."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's explicit request for green (#00FF00) as the primary color and blue (#0000FF) as the secondary color, instead generating a function call with incorrect color values (#FF5733 and #33D4FF)."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent correctly chose the BankruptcyFilingProcessor_processFiling tool and provided all necessary details, but the tool was duplicated in the available tools list. The function call format was correct—this failure likely stems from a tool registry or evaluator mismatch, not agent reasoning."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call to cultural_tour_experience, making the function call incomplete and not matching the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"influence\" parameter in the function call, which does not match the expected schema for cultural_event_classical_music_impact, leading to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call, which does not match the required function signature that expects only \"task_name\" and \"priority\" for each task, resulting in a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unnecessary city-level information (\"cities\": [\"Berlin\"], \"cities\": [\"Paris\"]) in the \"locations\" parameter, rather than only specifying the required country-level entries as expected by the function schema, leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the tool call in an incorrect XML-like wrapper (<tool_call>...</tool_call>) instead of a valid JSON object or array, causing the system to fail JSON parsing and reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent output malformed JSON in the tool call, likely due to incorrect formatting or extraneous characters, which prevented the function call from being parsed and executed as expected. The content was correct, but the structure was syntactically invalid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra fourth week in the \"training_schedule\" when only three weeks were specified by the user's intent, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter, \"analysisDepth\", to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" are valid, causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"radius\" argument to the FindNearbyMedicineDisposal function call, deviating from the expected parameters (only latitude and longitude), resulting in a function call format mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_23", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported argument (\"focusArea\": \"task management\") in the function call, which was not expected. The function should only receive \"teamSize\" and \"currentEfficiency\" parameters, causing a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"dietaryPreference\" in the function call; only \"foodOptions\" and \"servingSize\" should have been provided, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent ignored or failed to extract Guangdong's actual service sector growth (5.6) and foreign investment (900) data, instead submitting zeros for those values, leading to an incorrect and incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 5 instead of using the correct value of 1200, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input and failed the benchmark."}

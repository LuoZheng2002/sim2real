{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call, including only the first name, despite being given both first and last name in the user's response to the system's clarification request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the function call to SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery, which only accepts \"timePeriod\" and \"region\" according to the available tools' specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"pop\" (lowercase) for the genre parameter instead of \"Pop\" (capitalized), resulting in a parameter mismatch and the evaluator not recognizing the function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" argument in its function call, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature that resulted in no matching call being found. Only \"region\" and \"timeRange\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"eventTypes\" in the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, which does not match the expected or available function signature, resulting in no valid function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters (\"features\") to the simulation_parameters that were not expected or required, causing its function call to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluation failure. It should have used only the specified parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" field in the correctionPreferences parameter for each function call, causing a mismatch with the expected schema and resulting in no valid function calls being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values for both sites, incorrect date formatting for the Colosseum query, and failed to match the expected function call argument structure, resulting in no matching function call as required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent output the time parameters in ISO 8601 format with a 'Z' (UTC) suffix and seconds field (\"2023-05-28T12:00:00Z\"), while the expected format omitted the 'Z' and seconds (\"2023-05-28T12:00:00\"). This format mismatch caused the function call not to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly split the required actions into two separate function calls instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters into a single WebSecurity_EncryptionManager call as expected by the tool's interface."}

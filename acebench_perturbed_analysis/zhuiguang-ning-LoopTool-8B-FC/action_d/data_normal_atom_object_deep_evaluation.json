{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"time_range\" field for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" parameter, instead of only specifying the days as required. The function call's argument structure did not match the expected format, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly omitted the \"Sample\" prefix from the sample IDs, returning \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B,\" leading to a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported \"amenities\" parameters in the FamilyGatheringVenueFinder function call, deviating from the expected schema which only allowed \"location,\" \"date_range,\" and \"capacity.\" This caused the evaluator to reject the function call as a non-match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required privacy parameter \"participantData\": false when constructing the sessionDetails, and also formatted the startTime with a 'Z' (UTC marker) instead of the expected format, leading to a mismatch with the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"session_length\" when calling mood_enhancing_playlist_generator, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to map participant \"culture\" fields to their proper demonym forms (\"Vietnamese,\" \"British,\" \"Spanish\") as required by the etiquette_meeting_manager function schema, instead using country names, resulting in a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON is incomplete due to a missing closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON formatting and failure to parse, rather than an error in reasoning or task execution."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call within XML-like <tool_call> tags, instead of providing only the raw JSON. This extra formatting caused JSON parsing to fail, resulting in the evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included a period at the end of the address (\"123 Main St.\") instead of matching the expected parameter format (\"123 Main St\"), causing a function call mismatch due to strict string comparison."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a structural mismatch with the expected function call parameters. Both function calls must match the expected schema exactly, including empty \"settings\" objects where required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON by omitting closing braces for each tool call, leading to parsing failure. Additionally, it incorrectly set the penalty as 0.1 (10%) instead of 10, not matching the expected parameter format for the cancellation penalty."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a separate function call for indirect employment, as explicitly requested in the question and required by the benchmark. Both employment types should have been analyzed independently."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unnecessary \"winePreferences\" argument in the function calls, deviating from the required function signature, which expects only the \"cheese\" parameter. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its tool call by including an extraneous quotation mark after the responseTeams array, resulting in a syntax error and preventing successful parsing and execution of the intended function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" in its function call to content_moderation_analysis, which caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulted in the evaluator not recognizing the call as valid."}

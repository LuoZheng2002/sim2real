{"id": "normal_atom_enum_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra unsupported parameter \"investmentHorizon\" in the function call, which did not match the tool’s required signature, leading to the failure in recognizing the function invocation as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"contactMethod\": \"Email\" parameter in its function call, failing to provide all necessary arguments specified by the task and leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetail\": \"Summary\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature. This missing parameter caused the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_24", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetailLevel\" parameter (\"Detailed\") in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_30", "analysis": "The agent used \"Comprehensive\" for the detailLevel parameter instead of the required \"Detailed,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call."}

{"id": "normal_atom_enum_43", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize the timezone argument, passing \"Eastern Standard Time\" instead of the required \"EST,\" resulting in a non-matching function call. Proper argument formatting was not followed as per the tool's expected parameters."}

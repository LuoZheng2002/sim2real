{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required 'Admin' and 'User' roles in the setupUserRoles call, only specifying the newly added 'Supervisor' role, thus not fulfilling the full user request to set up all three roles."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"feedbackMethods\" instead of specifying \"feedbackId\" as \"most-recent\" in the function call, failing to match the required parameters for PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback as expected by the benchmark."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the specific location preference (\"near the Colosseum\") in the book_dining function call, instead providing only \"Rome\" as the location, thus failing to fulfill the user's request for a restaurant near the Colosseum."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (including enableAlerts and alertTime) in its festival_art_schedule_creator function call, failing to adhere to the tool's full schema and thereby producing an incomplete function argument structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary leading \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" parameter (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_48_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called SurveyResponseAnalysis_detailedReport instead of SurveyResultsAggregator_collect, failing to aggregate survey results and compute the specific metrics (response rate and average score) as requested. It misunderstood the required function for summarizing survey metrics."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used widget IDs \"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\" instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels,\" leading to a mismatch with the tool's required parameter format and causing the function call to be invalid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the schedule_meeting function call with correct arguments but used lowercase for the agenda field (\"finalize and sign the contract\") instead of capitalizing it as in the expected output (\"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing an exact match failure."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the \"preferences\" string, while the expected argument was \"cozy cottage with breakfast\". This discrepancy in phrasing caused the function call not to match exactly with the expected answer, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to update both the communication and impact analysis modules, instead of updating only the communication method to Email as requested. It over-modified by including irrelevant settings in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function with appropriate destination and dateRange parameters but omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter specifying demand-driven algorithm and forecasting, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110 instead of the correct $120.5 per person), failing to use the option that matches all requested coverages as provided in the prior tool result. This indicates a misunderstanding or mis-selection of the appropriate insurance quote."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"returnDate\" (\"2024-01-03\") in the travelDates parameter when calling travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals, despite the user specifying a round-trip. This led to an incomplete function call that didn't match the expected input."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"feedback_type\" parameter and added a \"form_title\" field not specified in the form schema, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected format and parameters."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent output \"monthly installments\" as the optionType instead of the expected \"installments,\" causing a mismatch with the required function parameters. This discrepancy led to the function call not being recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields: it did not include the \"existing_conditions\" field for each traveler (should be an empty array if not stated) and missed the \"duration\" field under \"coverage_options,\" both necessary for a proper function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete and improperly closed, missing the final bracket, resulting in a malformed payload that was unparseable by the evaluator.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"eclipseType\": \"total\" parameter in the function call, failing to specify the interest in total solar eclipses as explicitly requested in the user's question."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly identified the beneficiaries' relationships as \"Grandson\" and \"Daughter\" instead of both being \"grandchild,\" which led to a function call mismatch due to a parameter schema violation in the relationship field."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the time_frame parameter using full datetime strings with timestamps, whereas the function expects only date strings (YYYY-MM-DD). This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the required sourceId (\"1\") in the dataSources parameter, instead incorrectly setting sourceId to \"API\". This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected schema, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"start\" and \"end\" datetime parameters with a 'Z' suffix (indicating UTC), whereas the expected format omitted the 'Z' and seconds. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"includeHistoricalData\" parameter and used an incorrect timestamp format with \"Z\" and hours/minutes/seconds, instead of the expected format without \"Z\" and with time set to \"00:00:00\", causing function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption, instead of combining both operations into a single call as required by the tool's expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The model incorrectly formatted the function call by placing the parameters inside an \"arguments\" field with a nested \"campaignDetails\" object, rather than directly using a \"parameters\" field that matches the required schema, causing a mismatch with the expected tool API."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in the function call to AccountManager_verifyDocument, resulting in a mismatch with the expected API signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in its function call and slightly altered the speciesInfo fields, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format and causing the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data parameters, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected schema for store_setup_manager. This omission caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the function call argument as \"arguments\" instead of the required \"parameters\" key, causing the evaluator to reject the call despite otherwise correct name and parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only included one digital display in the \"branding\" section instead of two, as explicitly required by the prompt. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") in the child's profile instead of limiting them to the specified interests (\"Puzzles\", \"Reading\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and the function call being unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent output \"pure green tea leaves\" as the ingredient, while the expected input was \"green tea leaves.\" This mismatch prevented the evaluator from matching the function call, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_58", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included Wednesday as an available weekday instead of excluding it per the user's stated availability, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. All other details were correctly extracted."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile argument, causing its function call to differ from the expected parameters and resulting in a mismatch per the evaluator's strict schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent output cost adjustments as floating point numbers (0.0, 5.0) instead of integers (0, 5) as required, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent outputted the function call with parameter values for \"min\" and \"max\" budget as floating-point numbers (1000.0, 2000.0) instead of the expected integers (1000, 2000), resulting in a mismatch against the required signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent formatted the timeWindow values using a \"Z\"-terminated UTC datetime string with seconds, rather than the expected format without \"Z\" and missing seconds (\":00\"). This caused a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter format expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent overfilled the function parameters, embedding a full process breakdown and equipment list into the \"arguments\" instead of just specifying the required input (\"material_type\": \"Plastic\", details/type). This caused malformed, unparseable JSON and violated the expected tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used \"GreatWall_Beijing\" as the siteId instead of the required \"Great Wall Beijing,\" causing a mismatch with expected parameters and resulting in the evaluation error despite other arguments being correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent generated a tool call with malformed JSON—the outermost object was missing its final closing brace, causing a parsing error. This indicates a failure in properly formatting and closing the tool call payload."}

{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the user’s preferred category as \"Sports\" instead of \"Sports Goods,\" causing the addToCart function call to not match the expected parameters and fail the test."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent called loginUser with only email and password, omitting the required userPreferredLoginTime and loginFrequency parameters specified in the user's request and expected output. It also provided an incorrect password, ignoring the expected value."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the required indefinite article \"a\" in \"a town near Austin, TX\" for the UserHomeLocation parameter, causing the function call arguments to not exactly match the expected output and resulting in an evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent filled the UserPreferredCategories parameter as \"Books\" instead of the correct \"Wellness,\" resulting in a mismatched function call compared to the expected output."}

{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct user membership status (\"Bronze\") in the function call, instead using the generic value \"Standard\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and no valid function call match for evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a UserSpendingLimit value of 100 instead of the correct value of 350, failing to honor the user's usual spending limit as required by the task. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (updateUserProfile) but only provided the updated home location, omitting required fields like UserName, UserEmail, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday, resulting in an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required UserMemberStatus (\"Gold\") parameter in the calculateShippingCost function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call to updateUserProfile included only the updated email and home location, omitting other required fields such as UserName, UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, and UserBirthday, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}

{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the user's new password from \"Jessie90#\" to \"Jessie90#new\", introducing an unauthorized modification rather than preserving the user-specified new password. This led to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used \"Indian\" instead of the correct \"Indian restaurant\" for the RestaurantName parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"UserLoyaltyStatus\" and \"HomeLocation\" parameters in the processPayment function call, missing user context explicitly requested in the task, resulting in an incomplete and incorrect function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and improperly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter rather than leaving it null as expected, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the correct order name \"sushi order\" in the processPayment function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added dietary preferences (\"Gluten-Free\", \"Dairy-Free\") instead of using the required [\"None\"], introducing unsupported or hallucinated information not present in the user's request or ground truth, leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the RestaurantName, and \"Vegan\" instead of capturing the user's actual dietary preference (\"Spicy\"). It also hallucinated the restaurant name and misinterpreted the dietary requirement, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}

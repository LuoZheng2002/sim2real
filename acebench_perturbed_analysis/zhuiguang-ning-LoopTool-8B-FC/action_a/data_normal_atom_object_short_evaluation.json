{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the function call to SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery that are not part of the expected function signature, causing a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"printTime\" parameter in the function call that is not part of the available tool's interface, resulting in a non-matching function call despite otherwise correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"schedule\" parameter specifying daily execution at 6:00 AM, failing to include scheduling details in the function call as requested in the user's instruction."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"pop\" (lowercase) for the genre instead of \"Pop\" (capitalized), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported extra simulation features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") in the function arguments, causing the function call to not match the expected schema and resulting in a failure to execute the correct call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect longitude values for both locations (rounded or slightly inaccurate), and formatted the Colosseum date incorrectly (\"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\"), causing function call mismatches with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The root cause of the failure is the mismatch in the time format: the model output includes times with a 'Z' (indicating UTC), while the expected format lacks the 'Z'. This discrepancy caused the evaluator not to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly split the required actions into two separate function calls instead of combining them into a single call with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters as expected by the tool's multi-action capability."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added detailed \"time_range\" fields to the \"time_restrictions\" for each weekday, while the expected parameters required only the \"day\" field without specific time ranges. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the benchmark's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleIDs (\"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\"), resulting in function call arguments that did not match the expected schema. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"capacity\" parameter at the wrong level, outside \"search_criteria\" instead of nesting it within. This caused a schema mismatch with the expected function call format, resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false property under the \"privacy\" field in the sessionDetails argument, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema for ConferenceSessionManager_createSession."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to nest the articles array under the \"articles\" key within \"contentData\" as required by the expected function call schema, leading to a parameter structure mismatch and the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent output malformed JSON for the tool call by omitting a closing brace, resulting in invalid syntax. This prevented the call from being parsed, despite the content structure otherwise matching the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent outputted invalid JSON for the tool call, possibly due to a formatting error such as a missing bracket or improper structure. This prevented the function call from being parsed and executed, even though the logic and parameters were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary period in the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"themes\" parameter inside \"movieDetails\" instead of as a separate top-level parameter, resulting in a function call argument structure mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required empty \"settings\" field for the 'summary' widget in the second dashboard configuration, causing its function call to not match the expected schema despite otherwise correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to produce valid JSON by omitting closing braces, resulting in a parsing error. Additionally, it incorrectly represented the penalty as 0.1 (float) instead of 10 (integer or percent), mismatching the user's specification and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, failing to make a separate function call for indirect employment as explicitly requested in the question. Both direct and indirect employment analyses were required."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"winePreferences\" field in its function call arguments, deviating from the expected schema, which only required the \"cheese\" object. This schema mismatch prevented successful function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON due to an extra quotation mark after the closing bracket of \"responseTeams\", resulting in invalid syntax and failure to parse the tool call despite otherwise correct content."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\": \"Advanced\" in the function call, causing it to not match the expected content_moderation_analysis schema, which only accepts \"content\" and \"context\" parameters."}

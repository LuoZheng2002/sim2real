{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The model incorrectly added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter to the DataGuard_encryptBusinessData function call, which caused the output not to match the expected valid function signature. Only the allowed parameters should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent submitted the wrong value for the \"Utilities\" expense category, using 50 instead of the requested 500, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" field in the function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure. This missing parameter caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"analysisPeriod\" parameter in the function call to SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function input format. This omission caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in its function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a mismatched payload and thus failing to meet the function signature expected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (\"translationFeatures\") in the function call that were not specified or supported in the expected schema, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra argument \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\" in the function call, which is not present in the allowed parameters for CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments, leading to a mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect museumId (\"Louvre\" instead of \"LouvreMuseum\") and unnecessarily filled the navigationOptions.mustSeeExhibits with specific exhibits when the field should have been left empty, causing a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected input structure and causing the test to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified primary and secondary colors (\"#00FF00\" for green and \"#0000FF\" for blue), instead generating incorrect color values. This indicates a failure to correctly track and use the user's stated design preferences in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent output the function call parameters using \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters\" key and had lowercase text (\"valuation summary for properties involved\") for the \"details\" field instead of matching the expected casing, causing an exact match failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"targetGroup\" parameter (\"finance department\") in its function call, failing to specify that the survey is for the finance department as requested in the original question."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_49_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported \"accessibilityOptions\" parameters (audioDescription and textCaptioning) in the HeritageExplorer_getVirtualTour function call, which were not expected or defined in the expected parameters. This caused a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included city-level details (\"cities\": [\"Berlin\"], \"cities\": [\"Paris\"]) in the \"locations\" parameter, which expects only country-level information as per the function's defined parameters, leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent only included one week in the \"training_schedule\" instead of generating a multi-week (3-week) training plan as implied by the user's intent of prepping over time. This led to a function call that didn't match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the function call in an invalid format, encapsulating the JSON in custom XML-like tags (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\") instead of providing plain, parseable JSON, causing parsing failure. The tool call content was otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call in a custom XML-like <tool_call> block instead of the expected plain JSON, leading to a JSON parsing failure and preventing the function call from being executed as intended."}

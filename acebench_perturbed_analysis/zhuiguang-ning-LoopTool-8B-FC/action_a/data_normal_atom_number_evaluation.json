{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" in its ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, which prevented exact matching with the expected function signature that only allows \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"dietaryPreference\" parameter in the ProteinIntakeRecommender function call, which is not part of the function's expected parameters; only \"foodOptions\" and \"servingSize\" should be provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"minRating\": 4 parameter in the LocalFoodDeliverySearch function call, failing to restrict results to highly-rated options as implied by the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the provided and necessary data for service sector growth (5.6) and foreign investment (900), instead defaulting both to zero despite the original question’s focus on these metrics. This led to an incomplete and incorrect function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the \"receptionDelay\" parameter (10 instead of the expected 1200), failing to accurately represent the user's reported message delay and thus causing a mismatch in the function call."}

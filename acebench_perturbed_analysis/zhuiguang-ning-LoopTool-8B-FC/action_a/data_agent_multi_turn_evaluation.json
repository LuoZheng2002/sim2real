{"id": "agent_multi_turn_0", "analysis": "The agent repeatedly tried to send a message while Wi-Fi was off, but failed to call the turn_on_wifi function before sending. It relied on the user's confirmation instead of actively enabling Wi-Fi as required by the tools available."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to turn on Wi-Fi and log in to the device before attempting to send the message, resulting in no function calls being executed and no state changes, which prevented the required message from being sent."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to resend the user's message after deleting the oldest message to free up inbox space; it stopped after deletion without executing the required send_message call, so the new message was never delivered."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_7", "analysis": "The agent failed to extract the correct message content from Eve to Frank by not mapping user names to IDs and misusing \"You\" instead of \"Frank\" in function calls. It also erroneously deleted a message instead of retrieving its content, leading to incomplete reminder creation."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_10", "analysis": "The agent failed to place the food delivery order: after obtaining the product list from Domino's, it did not proceed to call add_food_delivery_order, leaving the order unplaced and the world state incorrect."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_11", "analysis": "The agent failed to place the food delivery order after logging in as Grace; it stopped after retrieving product information instead of calling add_food_delivery_order, leaving the order unplaced and Grace’s balance incorrect, resulting in a mismatch in the expected and actual world state."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to handle the \"inbox full\" error: it did not call get_earliest_message_id and delete_message before attempting to send a new message, resulting in the new message not being delivered and the world state not matching expectations."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_13", "analysis": "The agent failed to handle the \"inbox full\" error correctly. It did not call get_earliest_message_id or delete_message to remove the oldest message before retrying to send the new message, causing the message to Frank to be never sent and the world state to be incorrect."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_14", "analysis": "The agent failed to handle the \"inbox full\" error when sending the final message. It did not use get_earliest_message_id and delete_message to remove the oldest message before retrying to send, leaving the world state and sent messages incorrect."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_15", "analysis": "The agent deleted message_id 2 (the relevant message from Frank to Grace) instead of first identifying and deleting the true oldest (message_id 3) using the available get_earliest_message_id tool, causing loss of task-critical information from the inbox."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_16", "analysis": "The agent did not use the get_earliest_message_id tool to determine which message to delete when the inbox was full; instead, it guessed a non-existent message ID, resulting in failure to free space and send the required message."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_17", "analysis": "The agent failed to switch to using its own (Eve's) logged-in account for placing the food order after repeated failures with Frank's credentials, and as a result, did not proceed to place the order, clean up messages, or send the required message to Frank."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_18", "analysis": "The agent failed to handle the \"inbox full\" error when sending the message; it did not attempt to query and delete the oldest message before retrying, even though this is the standard approach when message capacity is reached."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_19", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct product name (\"Fresh Gift Pack\" instead of \"Fresh Gift Packs\") when placing the food order, causing the order to fail and preventing subsequent required actions (deleting the earliest message, calculating price, sending the completion message)."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_20", "analysis": "The agent repeatedly used the incorrect string \"经济舱\" (Chinese for \"Economy Class\") as the cabin argument instead of the required English value \"Economy Class,\" resulting in persistent function call failures and an inability to complete the booking."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly booked flight CZ4321 (July 16th) instead of the latest available flight CZ4352 (July 17th). It failed to select the latest flight as specifically requested by the user, leading to an incorrect reservation and user state."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_23", "analysis": "The agent failed to correctly identify the user's reservation due to mismatched user ID usage (\"Eve\" instead of \"user1\"), leading it to repeatedly report no reservation found and never attempt to modify the booking. It thus never called the modify_flight function."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_24", "analysis": "The agent erroneously issued multiple modify_flight calls for the same reservation, causing the user's bank balance to be reduced twice for the additional baggage fee, resulting in an incorrect world state with an overcharged user."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_27", "analysis": "The agent repeatedly used incorrect cabin class labels (\"经济舱\"/\"商务舱\" in Chinese) instead of the required \"Economy Class\"/\"Business Class\" in English, causing all reservation attempts to fail and no booking or state change to occur."}
{"id": "agent_multi_turn_28", "analysis": "The agent persistently used the Chinese term \"商务舱\" for the cabin class in the reserve_flight function instead of the required English \"Business Class,\" causing repeated errors and failure to complete the booking process as intended."}

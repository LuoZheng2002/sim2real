{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to use the tool specifically designed to address persistent vein visibility with associated symptoms, as required by the question and expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to extract and include the specific competitor analysis details and customer demographics provided in the context, and also returned generalized evaluation criteria instead of mapping them to the structured format expected by the function, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"conflict over AI control\" as the value for conflict_element instead of just \"AI control,\" failing to match the expected function parameter and resulting in a mismatch for function call evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the \"Urgent\" priority to the task instead of converting it to the expected \"High\" priority, resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to match the expected API parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called finance_advisor_b instead of finance_advisor_a, failing to select the required tool as specified. It did not map the user's request to the correct function despite both being available."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent output \"medium build\" for body_type instead of the expected \"medium,\" causing a parameter mismatch and resulting in no exact function call match as required by strict evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the health_tips_b function instead of health_tips_a, and failed to include the required \"age\" parameter, not matching the function and arguments specified by previous context and user request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent only restated the initial, minimal problem description instead of expanding it with detailed context as expected, thus failing to enrich the \"problem_description\" parameter with additional information and diverse perspectives when calling clarity_guide_b."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call arguments: it provided \"target\" as a separate list, rather than incorporating each target value into the corresponding dataset entry, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature for model_optimizer_y."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b as required, and also did not limit evaluation_metrics to only \"F1 score\" as specified in the follow-up request, failing to adapt its tool use and parameters to the updated user intent."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" for the relation value, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in failed function call recognition. The error stems from not matching the required field value exactly."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent used a non-standard age range format (\"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\") and provided an imprecise brand status (\"fairly new and currently not well-known\") instead of the expected concise value (\"not well-known\"), leading to parameter mismatches and failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent used title casing (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") instead of lowercasing (\"AI applications in oncology\") for the 'title' parameter, resulting in a non-exact match with the expected function call arguments."}

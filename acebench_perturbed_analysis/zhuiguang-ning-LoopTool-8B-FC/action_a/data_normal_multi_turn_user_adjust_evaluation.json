{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used informal date formats (\"March 8\", \"March 22\") instead of the required ISO format (\"2024-03-08\", \"2024-03-22\"), leading to a parameter mismatch and the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"feedbackId\" parameter (set to \"most-recent\") in its function call, providing only \"employeeId\". This omission caused the function call not to match the expected input, resulting in the benchmark failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only set up the 'Supervisor' role inheriting from 'Admin' and failed to also create the explicitly requested 'Admin' and 'User' roles, resulting in an incomplete setup that did not match the expected full roles list."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (with enableAlerts and alertTime fields) in its function call to festival_art_schedule_creator, resulting in a payload that didn't match the expected function signature for the tool."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The model output included \"to ensure compliance\" as the reviewReason instead of the expected \"ensure compliance.\" This mismatch in argument value caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the input validation function instead of the required TrackInnovationMetrics_calculateInnovationRate function, failing to calculate and track the innovation rates for transformational leader teams as requested."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the \"special_requests\" field and specified \"Rome\" as the location, instead of using \"near the Colosseum\" as the location in the book_dining function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updated communicationModule settings, instead of only changing the \"method\" to \"Email\" as requested, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", causing the evaluator to not match the function call. It failed to strictly align with the required API parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent output decimal values (70.0, 60.0) for innovationRate instead of integers (70, 60) as expected by the benchmark, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format and thus a failure in strict output matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call for schedule_meeting used \"agenda\": \"finalize and sign the contract\" with a lowercase \"f\", but the expected output required \"agenda\": \"Finalize and sign the contract\" with an uppercase \"F\", causing a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter with its subfields (\"algorithm\": \"demand-driven\", \"forecasting\": true), resulting in a non-matching call to the tool as per the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call used the preference string \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast\", leading to a mismatch with the strict expected parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used an insurance cost of $110 instead of the correct price of $120.5 per person from the given insurance options, resulting in the wrong argument in the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter in the function call, providing only the departure date despite the user specifying a round-trip (December 30th to January 3rd). This led to a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent made an unnecessary call to securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles; only configuring access control was required according to the task and expected answer. This led to an incorrect number of function calls."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" in the manage_feedback_collection function call, deviating from the required parameter structure. This prevented the function call from matching the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" instead of the expected \"installments\" for the optionType in repaymentOptions, leading to a parameter mismatch and no matching function call recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call—specifically, \"existing_conditions\" in traveler_details and \"duration\" in coverage_options—resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters for the travel_budget_manager_get_insurance_options function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent modified the desired_qualities value from the user's input (\"at least 10 years of industry experience\") instead of normalizing it to match the expected (\"10 years of industry experience\"), causing a mismatch in function call parameter formatting and resulting in evaluator failure."}

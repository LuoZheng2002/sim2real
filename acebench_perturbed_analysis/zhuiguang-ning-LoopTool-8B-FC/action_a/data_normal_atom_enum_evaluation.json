{"id": "normal_atom_enum_0", "analysis": "The agent added an extra unsupported parameter \"investmentHorizon\" in the function call, causing it not to match the expected signature and leading to evaluation failure. It should have used only the allowed parameters: region, analysisType, and dataSource."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"contactMethod\" parameter when calling SupplierNetworkExpander_findMatchingSuppliers, resulting in an invalid function call that did not satisfy the expected input schema for the tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetail\": \"Summary\" parameter in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus failing to generate a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_24", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetailLevel\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_34", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"eventType\": \"Concert\" parameter in its function call, ignoring the user's specific request for a concert event, which led to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter in the function call, failing to filter recommendations to games with good ratings as specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_43", "analysis": "The agent passed \"Eastern Standard Time\" instead of the required \"EST\" string for the timezone parameter, failing to match the expected function call signature. Proper normalization or mapping to the accepted timezone format was not performed."}

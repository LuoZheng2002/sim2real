{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"eclipseType\": \"total\" parameter in its function call, resulting in an incomplete request that would not restrict the analysis to only total solar eclipses as the user requested."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assigned the relationship of \"daughter\" to the sister beneficiary instead of \"grandchild,\" and used \"Grandson\" for the user instead of the correct neutral \"grandchild,\" causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The failure was due to the model outputting the time_frame values with full ISO date-times including time and \"Z\", instead of the expected date-only \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, causing a mismatch with the tool's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide the correct \"sourceId\" (\"1\") for the data source in its function call, instead using \"API\"; this mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"start\" and \"end\" time parameters with a \"Z\" suffix (indicating UTC) and included seconds, while the expected format lacked the \"Z\" and seconds, causing a mismatch in function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"includeHistoricalData\" parameter and used an ISO timestamp with a \"Z\" suffix, whereas the function expects a simpler \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS\" format and does not support \"includeHistoricalData\". This led to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly issued two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption instead of combining both actions into a single call as required by the tool's expected parameter structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent generated a campaign title, \"Hawaii Adventure Getaway,\" instead of using the required title \"Adventure and Travel in Hawaii\" as expected; otherwise, its function call structure and arguments were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent's function call used \"device_name\" values with capitalized letters (\"Smartphone\", \"Laptop\") instead of the expected lowercase (\"smartphone\", \"laptop\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter (\"immediate\") in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to register no valid call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" argument and used an overly specific common name instead of the general term \"bird,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data argument, resulting in a function call signature mismatch. This missing parameter prevented the output from matching the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The model made the correct function call in structure and parameters, but failed to match the signature expected by the evaluator due to naming the arguments \"imageData\" instead of \"image_data\" (or a mismatch in parameter formatting), causing the call to be unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only configured a single digital display instead of the required two, failing to match the expected function call parameters. All other aspects of the configuration were correct, but the incomplete branding argument caused the test case to fail."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included additional preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") in the childProfile instead of only \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as specified in the user's request, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" for the ingredients parameter, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's exact expected values for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_58", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included Wednesday in the user's available weekdays despite the user explicitly stating they are not available on Wednesday, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile argument, which was not expected, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The model failed to match the expected function call format due to parameter type discrepancies—it output costAdjustment values as floats (0.0, 5.0) instead of integers (0, 5), leading to a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_76", "analysis": "The agent called geo_coordinate_resolver instead of the required GeoLocator_reverseGeocode function, failing to match the expected tool name despite providing the correct arguments. This indicates an error in tool name selection rather than argument formatting."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The model's function call used floating-point values (1000.0, 2000.0) for the budget instead of integers (1000, 2000), causing a schema mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in no match."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent included seconds and \"Z\" (UTC timezone designator) in the timeWindow values, while the expected format required only hours and minutes with no timezone (\"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:00\"), causing parameter mismatch and function call rejection."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent overfilled the tool call arguments by including the entire recycling process and equipment details instead of only specifying required parameters (\"material_type\" and \"type\"). This led to malformed JSON, causing parsing failure and incorrect tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect siteId (\"Great Wall Beijing Segment\") instead of the expected \"Great Wall Beijing\", leading to a function call signature mismatch. The rest of the parameters were correct, but the site identifier string did not match exactly."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete due to a missing closing brace, resulting in parse failure. This syntax error indicates the agent did not properly format or terminate the JSON object before output."}

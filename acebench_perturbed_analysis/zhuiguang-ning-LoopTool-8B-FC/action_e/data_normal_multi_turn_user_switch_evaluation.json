{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_0_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter (\"Morning\") in its TravelMusicRecommender_getPlaylist function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to retrieve the appropriate playlist."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra \"additionalOptions\" parameter (with \"keyLength\": 256) to the DataGuard_encryptBusinessData function call, which was not part of the function specification, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to produce a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500, leading to a mismatch between the user’s specified expenses and the function call parameters. All other values were correctly provided."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus a failed test case."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Paris, France\" instead of just \"Paris\" for the location parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and leading the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in its function call, resulting in an incomplete payload that did not match the expected signature needed by CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (translationFeatures) to the CulturalTranslator_translateInteraction function call that were not part of the expected function signature, causing a mismatch and failure to match the call exactly as required."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId, and incorrectly included a non-empty mustSeeExhibits list, deviating from the expected parameters, causing the function call not to match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the function call, which caused a mismatch with the expected signature; only \"demographicFilters\" was required. This deviation led to the function call not being recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a function call that does not match the expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used #008000 (dark green) instead of the user-specified \"green\" as #00FF00 (bright green), failing to accurately interpret and apply the user's intended primary color value in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct function name and arguments, but used \"arguments\" instead of the required \"parameters\" key in its function call object, resulting in a schema mismatch that prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"group_size\" parameter in its function call to cultural_tour_experience, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature despite all other details being correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"influence\" parameter (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in its function call that was not expected according to the API specification, resulting in a non-matching function signature and thus a failed invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call arguments, which was not required by the tool specification, causing the call to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included city-level details (\"cities\": [\"Berlin\"], \"cities\": [\"Paris\"]) in the location parameters, whereas the function expected only country-level information. This parameter mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent wrapped the tool call JSON in unnecessary XML-like tags (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\"), which caused a parsing failure. The output should have been a plain JSON object, not embedded in additional markup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent produced a tool call with correct parameters but included invalid XML-like tags (<tool_call>...</tool_call>) around the JSON, causing JSON parsing to fail. The output should have been a raw, properly formatted JSON object without extra markup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call included four weeks in the training_schedule instead of the expected three, which caused a mismatch with the required function call parameters and led to evaluation failure."}

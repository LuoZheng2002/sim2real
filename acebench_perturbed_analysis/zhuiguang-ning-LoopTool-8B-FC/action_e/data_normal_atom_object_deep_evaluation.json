{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"time_range\" fields to each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" parameter, instead of simply listing the days as required. This led to a mismatch with the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to preserve the full sample IDs as provided by the user, truncating \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" to \"A\" and \"B\" in the function arguments. This loss of detail led to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"amenities\" field in the search_criteria, which is not part of the allowed parameters for the FamilyGatheringVenueFinder function. The function call did not match the expected schema, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required participantData field in the privacy object when calling ConferenceSessionManager_createSession, resulting in a mismatch between expected and actual function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter (\"session_length\": \"1 hour\") in the function call, causing it not to match the expected function signature and resulting in a failure to execute the mood_enhancing_playlist_generator properly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contained malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace, resulting in a parsing error. This prevented successful invocation of the function despite the logic and arguments being otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent outputted participants' cultures as country names (\"Vietnam\", \"UK\", \"Spain\") instead of the expected cultural adjectives (\"Vietnamese\", \"British\", \"Spanish\"), leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent placed the gear information as a top-level argument to the function call rather than nesting it correctly within hikingDetails.gear, resulting in a function call structure that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent output a tool call with invalid JSON formatting (likely due to an extra or missing bracket or character), causing a parsing failure and preventing the function call from being executed. Proper JSON syntax is required for successful function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a period in the location field (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in its function call arguments, making the calls structurally different from the expected output and failing strict argument matching required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the same-day cancellation penalty as 0.1 instead of 10 for R123 and R456, misinterpreting the penalty as a fraction rather than the correct numeric value, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, omitting the required analysis for indirect employment, thus failing to call the function separately for both employment types as requested in the original question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added \"servingTime\" and empty \"winePreferences\" fields to the function arguments, deviating from the expected parameter structure which included only \"name\" and \"characteristics\" for the cheese. This mismatch caused no matching function calls to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON in its tool call by including an extraneous quotation mark after the responseTeams array, resulting in a syntax error. This prevented the function call from being properly parsed and executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter to the content_moderation_analysis function call instead of matching the expected parameters, leading to a mismatch and failure to invoke the function as specified by the available tools."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to fully capture and aggregate the reported symptoms, omitting \"excessive crying\" and not synthesizing both symptoms into the expected parameters. This mismatch led to the function call not matching the benchmark's required arguments and symptom phrasing."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent generated argument values for the function call that did not match the expected schema or content, such as misnaming keys (\"brand_recognition_improvement\" instead of \"brand_recognition\") and providing placeholders or different data, leading to no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent used \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected \"AI control\" for the conflict_element parameter, leading to a mismatch and no recognized function call as per evaluator's strict matching criteria."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent failed to correctly update the task schedule by only including the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task with adjusted (High) priority, as required. Instead, it resubmitted all previous tasks plus the new one, without handling the intent to focus solely on scheduling the newly requested urgent task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent provided key parameters using semantically correct but structurally mismatched argument formats—specifically, using arrays and phrasing not matching the expected string fields—leading to exact function call mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the body_type value as \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium\", leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the required function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"include_statistics\" in the function call to eco_vision_B, which does not match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator not to recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a as expected, and omitted the required \"age\" parameter that should have been included in the function call to health_tips_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to clarity_guide_b used an overly brief problem_description, omitting important context about attempted troubleshooting steps and the request for diverse insights, leading to a mismatch with the expected detailed parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed \"target\" values as a separate list instead of associating each target value directly with its corresponding dataset entry. The expected function call requires each item to include both its features and target together within the dataset parameter."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b as required, and also used an incorrect evaluation_metrics format (list with \"accuracy\", \"recall\", \"F1 score\" instead of just [\"F1 score\"]). This indicates failure to select the correct tool and align parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" for the relation field in the function arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call parameters and thus a failure to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent's function arguments did not exactly match the expected parameters: it used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group and \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of the simplified \"not well-known,\" causing a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct function and parameters but its output format did not match the strict expected function call schema, resulting in an unrecognized function call by the evaluator."}

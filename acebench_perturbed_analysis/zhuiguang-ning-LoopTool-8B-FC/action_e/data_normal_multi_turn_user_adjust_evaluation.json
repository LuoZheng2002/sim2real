{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to convert the provided date strings (\"March 8\", \"March 22\") into the required ISO 8601 format (\"2024-03-08\", \"2024-03-22\") for the function parameters, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no recognized function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"most recent\" instead of the required \"most-recent\" format for the feedbackId parameter, resulting in a mismatched function call that didn't align with the expected tool usage specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only set up the 'Supervisor' role inheriting from 'Admin', but failed to also set up the 'Admin' and 'User' roles as required; it omitted explicitly defining all three roles in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_2", "analysis": "The agent provided a generic improvement area (\"communication skills\") instead of the specific areas (\"verbal communication\" and \"written communication\") identified in the feedback analysis, failing to match the granularity expected in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"auditEnabled\": true parameter in the function call to securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl, resulting in an incomplete and unmatched function invocation per the expected contract."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required notifications field (with enableAlerts and alertTime) in the function call to festival_art_schedule_creator, resulting in an incomplete parameter set that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to extract and specify the actual restaurant name for the reservation, instead using a generic description and location fields. The expected function call required a specific restaurant_name and more precise location, not just preference details."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed \"to ensure compliance\" as the reviewReason instead of the required literal \"ensure compliance\", causing the function call to not match the expected parameters exactly. The agent added extraneous text."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_48_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called SurveyResponseAnalysis_detailedReport instead of SurveyResultsAggregator_collect, failing to aggregate basic survey metrics like response rate and average score as requested. It focused on detailed analysis rather than summary aggregation as specified by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", causing a function call mismatch and evaluation failure. Naming accuracy for parameters was not maintained."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent fabricated identical (65%) innovation rates for both teams instead of using the provided data (70% for Team Alpha, 60% for Team Beta), failing to correctly retrieve or preserve team-specific innovation rates calculated previously. It did not reference the correct, per-team metrics."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call in structure and content, but the function call was enclosed in XML-like <tool_call> tags instead of the required JSON array format, causing a format mismatch and preventing evaluator recognition."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call specified \"preferences\": \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast\". The additional word \"included\" caused an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to modify both the communicationModule and the impactAnalysisModule instead of only changing the communication method to \"Email\" as requested. It should have left the other settings unchanged."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter specifying the demand-driven algorithm and forecasting in its travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected invocation and failure to account for dynamic pricing requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost value ($110 instead of the correct $120.5) when calling the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget function, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter (\"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\") in the manage_feedback_collection function call that was not expected, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter in the travelDates object for the function call, even though the user specified round-trip dates. This led to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the team led by a transactional leader and included it in the function call. Only teams with transformational leaders should have been passed, per the tool requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"monthly installments\" for optionType instead of the expected \"installments\" in repaymentOptions, causing a mismatch with the required function call schema and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"existing_conditions\" field in traveler_details and the \"duration\" field in coverage_options, both of which were expected in the function call parameters. This caused a mismatch with the required function input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON output was incomplete and missing the final closing brace, resulting in a malformed tool call that could not be parsed and executed, even though its structure and content were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent included \"at least 10 years of industry experience\" in the function arguments instead of matching the expected wording \"10 years of industry experience,\" causing a parameter mismatch and failure to generate a recognized function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_45_0", "analysis": "The agent placed \"travel_dates\" at the top level of the function call instead of nesting it inside \"user_preferences\" as specified in the expected parameters, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch for the virtual_travel_guide function."}

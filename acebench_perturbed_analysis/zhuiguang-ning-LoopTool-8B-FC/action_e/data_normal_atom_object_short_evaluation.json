{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call, passing only the first name, resulting in incomplete and mismatching input parameters for the expected function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent added extra parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") not part of the expected function signature. This caused its function call not to match the available tool's required parameter set, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and overly detailed information (the \"details\" array) in the protocol parameter, producing malformed JSON that could not be parsed, instead of restricting the arguments to only the required \"type\" and \"time\" fields as specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The model outputted the correct function and arguments, but used \"pop\" (lowercase) instead of \"Pop\" (capitalized) for the genre parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"dataSources\" argument in the function call, which was not part of the expected parameters, causing a mismatch with the required function signature and leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"eventTypes\" argument in its function call, which was not expected or supported. The expected function call required only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\" parameters, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported keys (\"features\") within the \"simulation_parameters\" argument that were not part of the tool's expected input schema, resulting in a function call mismatch rather than strictly matching the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values (precision off by 0.0002/0.0001) and formatted the year \"100 AD\" as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required four-digit \"0100-08-01\", resulting in no matching function calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent output the time values with a \"Z\" (UTC designator), while the expected format omits \"Z\"; this mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call, even though the call was otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption instead of combining both actions into a single call, as expected by the function's interface."}

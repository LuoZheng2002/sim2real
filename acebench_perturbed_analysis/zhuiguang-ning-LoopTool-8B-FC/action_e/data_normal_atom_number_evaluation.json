{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" argument in the function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameter schema and causing the function call not to be recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_23", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"focusArea\" parameter (\"task management\") in the TeamEfficiencyAnalyzer function call, which does not match the expected parameters and thus caused the evaluator to reject the call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"dietaryPreference\" parameter in the ProteinIntakeRecommender function call, which was not expected or supported, leading to a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the \"minRating\": 4 parameter in the LocalFoodDeliverySearch function call as required to filter for highly-rated delivery options, resulting in an incomplete and less relevant response."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect values for \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment\" (0.8 and 500 instead of the expected 5.6 and 900), failing to elicit or appropriately infer these required parameters before calling EconomicDevelopmentMetrics."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_33", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"characterName\" parameter (\"Itachi Uchiha\") in its GetCharacterBackground function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. Only \"animeId\" and \"includeSpoilers\" were provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent set the receptionDelay parameter to 5 instead of the expected 1200, likely misunderstanding the appropriate value or unit for representing message delay duration. This prevented the function call from matching the expected input."}

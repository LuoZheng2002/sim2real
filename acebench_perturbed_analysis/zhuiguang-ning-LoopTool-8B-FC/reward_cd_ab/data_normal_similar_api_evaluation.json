{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent omitted the symptom \"excessive crying\" in the additional_symptoms list and did not fully summarize \"baby_behaviors\" as \"constant crying and decreased appetite,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected structured parameters for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to align its function call parameters with the expected schema: it used inaccurate or non-informative competitor analysis, mismatched demographic attributes, and produced evaluation_criteria keys not matching those required by the S_S_A tool, causing a schema mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"conflict over AI control\" as the conflict_element argument instead of the required value \"AI control,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to produce a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called task_schedule_a_1 with all tasks instead of calling the T_S_A tool with only the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task as specified, and it assigned an incorrect priority (\"Urgent\" instead of \"High\")."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent called \"vlookup_step_guide_1\" instead of the intended lower-cost but equivalent \"V_S_G\" tool, failing to match the required function name in the expected output and not optimizing for the lowest cost tool as required."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The function call failed because the agent used slightly incorrect argument values—specifically, it added \"sectors\" to \"technology and renewable energy,\" paraphrased the financial_status, and did not match the expected wording for the short-term goal, leading to a strict parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"style_recommendation_a_1\" instead of \"S_R_A\", failing to use the expected, lower-cost function that provides the same service. This indicates a mismatch in tool selection despite overlapping descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected the \"health_tips_b\" function instead of the required \"H_T_A\" function, and also omitted the user's age parameter when making the function call, failing to match the expected tool usage and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to C_G_B included only the brief original problem description rather than an expanded or detailed one, failing to incorporate clarification steps and additional context from the preceding interaction as required by the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent called analyze_social_data_a instead of the correct A_S_D_B function as required, and also formatted preprocess_rules as a dictionary instead of a list, resulting in a function signature mismatch and an incorrect function being invoked."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent selected the poetry_analysis_b tool instead of the required P_A_A tool, failing to match the expected function call despite similar available options. This indicates an incorrect tool choice, likely due to misunderstanding names or prioritizing descriptions over explicit function name matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"relation\" field as \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" and added extra detail (\"causes tension\") to the \"status\" field; this mismatch caused the function call arguments not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent used slightly different parameter formatting (\"25 to 35\" vs \"25-35\" and a longer \"current_brand_status\" string), causing a mismatch with the strictly expected argument format, leading the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent correctly identified and called the appropriate function (M_AG) with relevant parameters, but a minor mismatch in the capitalization of the \"title\" argument (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs. \"AI applications in oncology\") caused the function call not to match exactly as expected."}

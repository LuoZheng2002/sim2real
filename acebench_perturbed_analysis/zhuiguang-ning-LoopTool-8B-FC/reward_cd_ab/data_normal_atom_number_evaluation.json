{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported argument \"analysisDepth\" to the STE function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and preventing recognition as a valid call. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" should have been used."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent called the LFDS function with only the \"city\" parameter, omitting the required \"minRating\" parameter to filter for highly-rated restaurants, as implied by the user's request. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent omitted the provided foreignInvestment (should be 900) and serviceSectorGrowth (should be 5.6), instead submitting default or zero values, leading to an incorrect function call that didn't use all user-supplied data."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_33", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"characterName\" parameter (\"Itachi Uchiha\") in its GCB function call, providing only \"animeId\" and \"includeSpoilers.\" This omission made the call incomplete and incorrect according to the tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 10 instead of the expected 1200, likely failing to solicit or infer the actual delay experienced by the user, resulting in an incorrect function call."}

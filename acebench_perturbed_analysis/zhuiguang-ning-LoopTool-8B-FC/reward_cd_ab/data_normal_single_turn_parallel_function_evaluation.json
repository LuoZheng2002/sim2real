{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_2", "analysis": "The agent only made two function calls (one per model/period pair) instead of four; it failed to produce all combinations of prediction model and forecast period as requested, missing two required calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_3", "analysis": "The agent used a single-day time frame (\"2025-10-09\" to \"2025-10-09\") for the T_M licensing queries instead of the required yearly period (\"2025-01-01\" to \"2025-12-31\"), leading to no match with the expected function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_7", "analysis": "The model outputted function calls with an \"arguments\" field instead of the expected \"parameters\" field, resulting in no matching function call being recognized by the evaluator. The mismatch in JSON structure is the root cause."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_8", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (CreativeSession_startWritingSession_1) for initiating the writing session instead of CS_WS, missing parameters for genre, duration, complexity, and themes.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary document_id fields in the I_C_V function call's documents list, which do not match the function's expected parameters. This extra information caused the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"interactions\" field to the \"details\" parameter in all TT_VT function calls, deviating from the required schema, which only allows \"settlements\" and \"routes\". This caused the evaluator to reject the calls as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the lower-cost RBRS_BS function for evaluating snake bite severity and instead called ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity_1 with no parameters, missing required bite details and symptom severity as specified in the original query and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent's PCE_PDF function call omitted the required \"themes\" parameter (specifically \"Existentialism\"), resulting in no match with the expected function signature. It failed to correctly apply the existential themes filter when searching for pre-2000 purpose-driven films."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent's call to VIM_VR omitted the required \"documentTypes\" parameter (should include [\"passport\"]), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and thus was not recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_40", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the required TS_C function for telemedicine setup and instead used the similar but wrong telemedTechSetup_configure_1 tool, resulting in a mismatch with the specified function expected by the benchmark."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected PhilosophyCinemaAnalyzer_analyzePhilosophicalThemes_1 instead of the required PCA_PT tool for analyzing philosophical themes in \"Inception,\" thereby failing to use the correct (and lower-cost) function as specified by the task requirements."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent combined all vehicles into a single STS_VIC call with an array, instead of making separate calls for each vehicle with their specific context and required infrastructure responses, thus failing to produce the required number and structure of function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_50", "analysis": "The agent added unexpected \"terms\" fields to the REBA_N function calls, which do not match the required schema.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_74", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"350-450 °C\" and \"300 - 400 °C\" (with spaces and degree symbol separated), while the expected format was \"350-450°C\" and \"300 - 400°C\" (no space before °C). This formatting difference caused the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly merged both tasks into a single call to T_G_B_I, including audio processing parameters that should have been handled separately by the A_E_P function; it failed to make two distinct function calls as required."}

This led to the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_88", "analysis": "The agent omitted \"includeEvents: false\" in the Colosseum request, likely defaulting the field to absence instead of explicitly setting it to false, resulting in a function call that does not exactly match the expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required security question and answer fields in the function call to P, omitting necessary parameters explicitly referenced in the user's request for security question-based password reset."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the more precise required category \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories in the TC function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in test failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent's function call to \"U\" only included email and password, omitting required parameters \"userPreferredLoginTime\" and \"loginFrequency,\" thus failing to fully capture and process the user's login preferences as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected \"UserHomeLocation\" value (\"a town near Austin, TX\") by omitting the leading \"a\", leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call despite the correct function and other arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent used \"Books\" instead of the correct user preference category \"Wellness\" for UserPreferredCategories, failing to accurately extract or apply the user's preferred categories in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMemberStatus\": \"Bronze\" parameter in the SC function call, instead using \"Standard,\" which does not match the expected input tied to stated membership benefits. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used a UserSpendingLimit value of 100 instead of the correct limit of 350, failing to preserve the user's actual spending restriction as expected by the test case. All other parameters matched."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent used the function \"UP\" but provided \"San Diego, CA\" instead of the required \"San Diego, California\" for UserHomeLocation, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect member status (\"Platinum\" instead of \"Gold\") when calling the SC function, resulting in no exact parameter match with the expected call and thus failure to fulfill the benchmark's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields (\"UserLanguage\", \"UserTimeZone\", \"UserBirthday\") in its UP function call, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent set the \"OrderStatus\" parameter to \"Pending\" instead of updating it to the required \"Out for Delivery\" status, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input for OU and causing the evaluator to reject it."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly supplied both \"Gluten-Free\" and \"Shellfish-Free\" as UserDietaryPreference, whereas the expected call only included \"Gluten-Free.\" This parameter mismatch led to the function call not matching the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in its call to the P function, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Jessie90#new\" as the new password instead of \"Jessie90#\", which did not match the expected function call parameters, leading to the mismatch and failed test case."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the function call to P, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Indian\" instead of \"Indian restaurant\" for the RestaurantName parameter, resulting in no match with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to register a failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the \"OrderName\" value as \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected lowercase \"dinner order,\" resulting in a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter value check and causing the function call to not be recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used the generic restaurant name \"Japanese restaurant\" instead of the specific \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\", and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\": \"Vegan\" in the function call, while the expected call required UserDietaryPreference to be null."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sushi Platter\" as the OrderName instead of the required \"sushi order,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Gluten-Free\" as UserDietaryPreferences instead of \"None\" as expected, introducing an ungrounded dietary preference not specified by the user. This caused the function call to not match exactly, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly substituted \"Kimchi Palace\" for the requested restaurant name (\"My favorite Korean joint\") and incorrectly used \"Vegan\" as the dietary preference instead of \"Spicy,\" failing to accurately ground the function call in the user's explicit instructions."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function (\"R\") but provided incorrect parameter values for \"Amount\" and \"UserRefundPreference\", not matching the expected world state; \"Amount\" should be 350, \"UserRefundPreference\" should be \"Store Credit\", not supplied values or user's stated preference."}

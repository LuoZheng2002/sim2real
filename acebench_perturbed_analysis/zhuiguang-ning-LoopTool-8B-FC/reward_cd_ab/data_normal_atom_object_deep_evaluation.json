{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent supplied the tool CDA_VD with arguments directly at the top level, instead of structuring them under the required \"votingContext\" parameter, resulting in a function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added detailed \"time_range\" specifications to the \"time_restrictions\" for each weekday, but the function only accepts a list of days without time ranges. This schema mismatch caused the function call to be unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleID fields and did not nest the parameters under the expected \"monumentDetails\" key, resulting in a function call format mismatch with the expected API schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent called the function publicSpeaking_coach_1 instead of S_C, despite both offering similar services. The expected function was S_C due to its lower cost, but the agent failed to select it, leading to a mismatch in function calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent attempted to call both \"festivalEventsManager_createVirtualExperience_1\" and the correct \"EM_VE\" tool, but the JSON for the \"EM_VE\" call was malformed (missing closing braces), causing parsing failure despite otherwise correct parameter organization."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked \"GlobalCulturalEventPlanner_1\" instead of the required \"GCEP\" function, despite both being available and \"GCEP\" being explicitly expected. This mismatch in function selection caused the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field within the privacy settings in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function invocation and failure to comply with the session creation parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_17", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function—GeoArchDesign_collaborateProject_1—instead of the required GAD_P function, despite both having the same capability. The task expected strict adherence to the function name GAD_P, not a synonym or variant."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"session_length\" in the function call to M_E_P_G, causing the call not to match the expected schema and leading to evaluator rejection. Only \"current_mood\" and \"favorite_genres\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was malformed due to a missing closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. This indicates a failure to properly construct and output syntactically correct JSON for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contained malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace, resulting in a syntax error. This prevented the tool call from being parsed and executed, despite the arguments otherwise being correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent used the more expensive \"comfortControl_manageWhiteNoise_1\" tool instead of the expected \"C_WN\" tool, and outputted invalid JSON with a trailing comma or format error, causing a parsing failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent's function call included an extra \"capacity\" parameter not expected by the CAC_CP tool, and added a period to the \"location\" value. This caused a mismatch with the tool's required input schema, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_29", "analysis": "The agent called travelPlanner_queryTrainSchedules_1 instead of the required P_TS function, despite both offering similar functionality. The root issue is incorrect function selection, failing to use P_TS as instructed or expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"communityWeatherPlanner_scheduleEvent_1\" instead of the expected \"WP_E\" function, failing to use the lower-cost and otherwise functionally-equivalent tool specified for this scenario."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent called the higher-cost function PhilosophyCinemaAnalyzer_analyzePhilosophicalThemes_1 instead of the lower-cost, functionally equivalent PCA_PT tool, which was expected by the benchmark; it also did not match the required function call name."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent's first tool call JSON was malformed due to a missing closing brace, causing a parsing error. Additionally, it used inconsistent tool names (both \"MarketDashboard_createInteractiveDashboard_1\" and \"MD_ID\" instead of just \"MD_ID\") and omitted an empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"existingTrees\" field (should be an explicit empty array) for the second street in its function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected schema, which requires \"existingTrees\" to be present for both entries."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly interpreted the \"10% penalty\" as a numeric value of 0.1 instead of 10, leading to function calls with an incorrect \"penalty\" parameter. This mismatch caused the calls to not match the expected output format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only made a function call for direct employment, omitting the required separate call for indirect employment, thus failing to analyze both employment types as requested in the original task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra winePreferences argument in the function call payload, causing the function call to not match the expected schema, which only required the cheese field with name and characteristics."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its tool call by including an extra double quote after the responseTeams array, making the output unparsable and causing a function call failure. The core issue is incorrect JSON formatting."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in its function call to C_M_A, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}

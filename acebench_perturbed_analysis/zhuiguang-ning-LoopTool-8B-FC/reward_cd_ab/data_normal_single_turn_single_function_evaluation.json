{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required \"sourceId\" (\"1\") for the data source in the function call; instead, it used \"API\" as the sourceId, which does not correspond to the expected identifier, leading to a mismatch with the evaluator."}

It also failed to provide the necessary detailed parameters for the campaign."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the device names' case (\"Smartphone\", \"Laptop\" instead of \"smartphone\", \"laptop\") to the expected parameters, leading to a mismatch and thus no matching function call found by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in the SC_F function call and altered the \"feature\" wording (\"distinctive long beak\" instead of \"long beak\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data and did not include \"San Francisco\" in the store_details location, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent used a placeholder string (\"base64 encoded string of the image data\") instead of the actual base64 image data provided by the user, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only created one digital display instead of two as requested, failing to include both required displays in the DO_C function call's branding.digitalDisplays array, which led to the evaluator not finding a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included additional preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") not mentioned in the user's request, instead of limiting preferences to only \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as specified. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_53", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested \"creditHistoryProviders\" and \"analysisPeriod\" inside \"userData\" instead of at the top level of parameters, resulting in a malformed function call that could not be parsed as valid JSON by the tool."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The model output used \"pure green tea leaves\" as the ingredient instead of the expected \"green tea leaves.\" This mismatch caused the evaluator to consider the function call as not matching the expected schema."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent output the correct tool and arguments, but failed due to a mismatch in function call format—specifically, it used \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters\" field, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent output float values (0.0 and 5.0) for costAdjustment instead of the expected integers (0 and 5), resulting in a mismatch with the required function call schema and the evaluator's expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name \"RA_MO\" with properly structured arguments, but likely failed to follow the exact function call schema required by the evaluator, possibly due to argument formatting (float vs integer for budget) or non-standard key usage."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent formatted the function call output as a raw <tool_call> block instead of using the expected structured function call format, resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call despite the parameters being correct."}

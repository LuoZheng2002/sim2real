{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter (\"additionalOptions\": {\"keyLength\": 256}) in the tool call that is not part of the DG_BD function's signature, causing the output to not match the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the user-specified 500 for each month, resulting in a function call mismatch with the expected parameters. The error is due to misreading or misrepresenting the provided expense data."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to IP_TRO, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature, which required this field to be present."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included extra unsupported parameters (\"translationFeatures\": {\"idiomaticExpressions\": true, \"culturalInsights\": true, \"pronunciationAdjustments\": true}) in the CT_I function call, deviating from the expected function signature and causing the call not to match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter, and populated mustSeeExhibits in navigationOptions when it should have been an empty list, leading to a mismatch with the expected ME_EI function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\" in its function call to CDM_CS, causing the call not to match the expected format and leading to a failed test case."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified color preferences, using incorrect primary (\"#FF5733\" instead of \"#00FF00\") and secondary (\"#33D4FF\" instead of \"#0000FF\") color values in its L_D_C function call, rather than strictly following the user's instructions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call to TIO_B omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent correctly called the BFP_F function with appropriate parameters, but the mismatch in formatting of the \"details\" field (capitalization) caused the evaluator to not recognize it as a matching function call, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"targetGroup\" parameter (\"finance department\") in its HRMA_CS function call, failing to specify which group the survey targets as per the original user request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent's function call to C_T_E omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"influence\" field (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in the function call arguments, which was not part of the allowed or expected parameters for the C_E_C_M_I tool, thus resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_30_0", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"update_frequency\", \"time_range\", \"cataloging_options\") in the N_S_M function call, rather than restricting the call to only the required \"system_id\" and \"visualization_details\" fields as specified."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") to the CT_I function call that were not supported or expected, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature and failure to match the expected output."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call arguments, which was not part of the expected schema. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"cities\" fields (\"Berlin\" and \"Paris\") inside the \"locations\" parameters, while the function expects only the \"country\" for each location. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected schema."}

This caused a signature mismatch and function call rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call in an XML-like wrapper (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\") instead of plain JSON, violating the expected output format and causing JSON parsing to fail. The inner JSON was correct, but the extraneous markup led to the error."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the function call inside a pseudo-XML <tool_call> tag, which is not valid JSON and caused a parsing failure. The response format did not strictly adhere to the required JSON syntax for tool invocation."}

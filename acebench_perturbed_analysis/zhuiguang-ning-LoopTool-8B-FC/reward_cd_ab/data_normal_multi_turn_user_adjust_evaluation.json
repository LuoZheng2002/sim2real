{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to convert the provided date range (\"March 8\" and \"March 22\") to the required \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format (\"2024-03-08\" and \"2024-03-22\"), resulting in a function call argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_17_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called CustomerDataBackupManager_cancelBackup_1 instead of the lower-cost CDBM_B function, despite both serving the same purpose. It failed to select the optimal tool as per expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_13_0", "analysis": "The agent called the function translateAndSynthesize_runTranslation_1 instead of the correct AS_T, and it omitted specifying required speech synthesis options (voice type, speech rate, speech qualities) in its function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_17_1", "analysis": "The agent made two function calls—first to CustomerDataBackupManager_viewBackupStatus_1 without specifying a job ID, then to CDBM_BS with the correct job ID—instead of only making the single, correct call to CDBM_BS with the backupJobId \"bk123\" as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent passed \"most recent\" as the feedbackId argument, but the expected parameter format was \"most-recent\" (with a hyphen). This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected call, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only set up the new 'Supervisor' role inheriting from 'Admin' but failed to include the previously-defined 'Admin' and 'User' roles in its MAPI_UR call, resulting in an incomplete user role setup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong function, calling securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles to define roles rather than using MAPI_AC to configure both roles and their permissions as required by the task and available tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent used the broader location \"Rome\" instead of the user's specified preference \"Trastevere,\" failing to incorporate the required level of location specificity from the user's instructions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" argument (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the expected value (\"ensure compliance\"), causing the function call not to match the expected parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the \"updatedToolSettings\" for \"communicationModule\". The expected update was to change only the \"method\" to \"Email\", not to respecify or alter other communication settings."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the \"special_requests\" parameter instead of the \"location\" field when calling B_D, and set \"location\" to \"Rome\" instead of the requested vicinity, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent formatted its function call output using an incorrect structure (raw JSON with <tool_call> tags), instead of matching the expected function call interface (e.g., \"name\" and \"parameters\" keys at the root), causing the evaluator to not recognize the function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_ids (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels.\" This mismatch prevented the evaluator from finding a matching function call, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The model failed to match the expected function call format, likely due to the agenda field's case sensitivity—outputting \"finalize and sign the contract\" (lowercase) instead of \"Finalize and sign the contract\" as expected, resulting in an evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (DA_D) with the right destination and date range, but it omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (including \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\"), resulting in an incomplete and invalid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent added \"included\" to the \"preferences\" field instead of matching the expected value \"cozy cottage with breakfast,\" leading to a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call to DA_FD omitted the required \"returnDate\" in the \"travelDates\" parameter, specifying only the \"departureDate.\" This caused a mismatch with the expected input, which included both \"departureDate\" and \"returnDate\" as provided by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost value ($110 instead of the correct $120.5) in the T_B_M_C_T_B function call, failing to select the appropriate insurance option corresponding to the scenario described in the insurance options provided."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter in the M_F_C function call that was not expected, resulting in a mismatch with the required function signature. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the team with a transactional leader and included it in the TIM_IR function call, which should only process teams led by transformational leaders as described in the tool documentation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields: \"existing_conditions\" in \"traveler_details\" and \"duration\" in \"coverage_options\". Even if these are empty or must be calculated, they must be present to match the expected schema. This led to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"monthly installments\" as the optionType instead of the expected \"installments\" in the repaymentOptions, resulting in a mismatch with the function signature and failure to generate a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's JSON output for the tool call was malformed, missing the closing braces needed to complete the outer object. This caused a parsing error and prevented the function call from executing despite correctly structured content otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the \"desired_qualities\" value by adding \"at least\" to \"10 years of industry experience\", causing an argument mismatch. It should have used the exact qualities specified, matching the expected function call parameters precisely."}

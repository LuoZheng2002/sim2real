{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_1", "analysis": "The agent called the function education_schedule_student_events_1 instead of the cheaper, functionally equivalent E_S_S_E as expected, despite both being available. The root cause is failure to choose the correct, lower-cost function for scheduling student events."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent included extra parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the SA_HI function call that are not supported or expected, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_14", "analysis": "The agent used the higher-cost \"security_generate_alias_1\" function instead of the functionally identical but cheaper \"S_G_A\" function, which was required by the expected answer. The call format was otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"pop\" (lowercase) instead of \"Pop\" (capitalized) for the genre parameter, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected input and caused the evaluator to reject it."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_23", "analysis": "The agent called \"presentation_add_background_music_1\" instead of the cheaper and otherwise equivalent \"P_A_B_M\" function, failing to prefer the expected tool and thus mismatching the function name required by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra \"eventTypes\" argument to the CTG_T function call, which was not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a non-matching function call despite using the correct tool and core parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_31", "analysis": "The agent called the function \"olympics_get_top_athletes_1\" instead of the expected \"O_G_T_A\" function, despite both offering the same functionality. The error occurred due to incorrect function selection among the available options."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported simulation features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") in the S_E_S function call arguments. The tool expects only the specified parameters, so this extra information caused the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unnecessary arguments (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") in the T_F_L_A_D function calls instead of matching the required parameters structure, causing the evaluator to reject these calls as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the TimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress_1 function instead of the more cost-effective TTG_A function required by the benchmark, and also did not match the required parameter formats exactly (e.g., coordinate precision, date zero-padding)."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made a single batch call with all patient IDs to \"hospital_record_fetch_1\" instead of making separate calls to \"H_R_F\" for each patient as expected, resulting in a mismatch in number and type of function calls."}

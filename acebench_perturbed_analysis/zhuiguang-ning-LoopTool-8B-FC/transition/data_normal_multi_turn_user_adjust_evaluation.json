{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_13_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to call any tool and instead returned a generic error message unrelated to the user's request, missing the required invocation of the translateAndSummarize_runSummary tool for summarizing the provided Spanish text in English."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the retail_data_export_tool as required, instead responding with an apology and intention but no action. It did not include a tool call in its output despite having the necessary information to execute the export."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent generated \"feedbackId\": \"most recent\" instead of the expected normalized format \"most-recent,\" causing a function call mismatch due to inconsistent argument formatting."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required 'User' role when calling securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles, only including 'Admin' and 'Supervisor'. It failed to include all specified roles as previously configured, resulting in an incomplete function call."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" field (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" in the updated communication module settings, whereas only \"method\": \"Email\" should have been specified. This argument mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The root cause is a capitalization mismatch in the agenda parameter (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs. \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), leading to an exact match failure in the evaluator despite functionally correct details."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" into the special_requests field instead of the required location field for the book_dining function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided Team Alpha's innovation rate as 65 instead of the correct 70, indicating it averaged the rates or reused a summary statistic rather than preserving each team's actual calculated innovation rate for the detailed report."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required insurance_cost parameter ($120.5) in the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget function call, despite having already provided travel insurance options with price details in a previous response."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (with \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\") in its function call, which is necessary for travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals to properly utilize dynamic, demand-driven pricing as described in the tool's capabilities."}

This led to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent added \"included\" to the \"preferences\" field (\"cozy cottage with breakfast included\") instead of matching the expected value (\"cozy cottage with breakfast\"), causing the function call arguments to differ from the benchmark requirement."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"form_title\" and \"feedback_type\" fields in the manage_feedback_collection call, which do not match the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to call the function as specified."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter, and incorrectly included a non-empty mustSeeExhibits list and exhibits not specified by the user, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of the expected \"#00FF00\" (a bright green) for the primary color, failing to match the precise shade the benchmark expects for \"green.\" This caused the output to not match the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This missing parameter caused the evaluator to reject the output as incomplete."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent only generated a training schedule for week 1 instead of providing a multi-week (e.g., 3-week) schedule as expected, leading to a parameter mismatch and no matching function call."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the correct tool name and arguments but failed due to improper formatting—wrapping the JSON tool call in XML-like <tool_call> tags, which broke JSON parsing. The error is purely in how the function call was serialized, not its content."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent produced an invalid tool call format by wrapping the JSON tool invocation in XML-style <tool_call> tags, resulting in a parse error. The function call itself was correct, but the added tags broke JSON parsing."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call parameters, providing only the first name (\"Helena\") instead of the complete information requested. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in its function call, which do not match the expected schema for SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery, leading to a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in the function call. This extra argument caused the function call to not match the expected schema, resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary and malformed \"details\" array within the \"protocol\" argument, causing invalid JSON output and a function call format mismatch with the tool's expected parameters. This led to a parsing failure and prevented successful function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"schedule\" parameter (time and frequency) when calling the tool and produced malformed JSON with an extra closing brace, causing both semantic and syntax errors and failing to schedule the automated tests as requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used a lowercase \"pop\" for the genre parameter instead of the expected capitalized \"Pop,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and the function call not being recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" parameter in its function call which is not part of the available tool's specification, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the expected input schema for CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline, leading to a failure to match the required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra \"features\" parameters (e.g., gravity simulation, density mapping, fragmentation algorithms, 3D visualization) that were not part of the expected function signature, causing the function call to not match the expected input structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") not present in the expected function signature, resulting in a function call format mismatch and thus failure to match the required function calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" parameter in its function calls' correctionPreferences; only \"intensity\" was expected, causing the calls not to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values and an invalid date format (\"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\"), causing its function call arguments not to match the expected ones, leading to an evaluator mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent formatted the time parameters with a trailing \"Z\" (indicating UTC) in the ISO timestamp, while the expected format omitted the \"Z\". This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls instead of a single combined call with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters together, as required by the function's interface and the expected answer."}

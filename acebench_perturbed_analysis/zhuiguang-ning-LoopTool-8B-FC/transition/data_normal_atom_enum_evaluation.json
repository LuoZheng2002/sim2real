{"id": "normal_atom_enum_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required tool; instead, it responded conversationally, did not use any tool call tags, and did not perform the expected function call to analyze message delays with the provided platform and network type parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"contactMethod\": \"Email\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the appropriate tool by not issuing any tool call at all; instead, it gave a placeholder response about an API issue and retrying, resulting in no attempt to satisfy the user's request for recipes."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"outputDetail\" parameter (\"Summary\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_24", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetailLevel\" parameter (\"Detailed\") in its function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to properly invoke the expected function with all necessary arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke the required function call to suggest improvements for AI response speed. Instead, it produced a generic error message unrelated to any tool use, ignoring the available AIResponseImprovementAdvisor_suggestEnhancements tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_34", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"eventType\": \"Concert\" parameter in the function call, omitting the user's specific request for a concert and making the call too generic to match the expected behavior."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"weatherDetail\" parameter to the FlightStatus_checkFlightAndWeather function call, which expects only \"airportCode\" and \"flightNumber\". This parameter mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter in the function call, omitting the requested criterion for games with good ratings, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_43", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize \"Eastern Standard Time\" to the accepted \"EST\" abbreviation in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameter value and preventing successful function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_44", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the value \"High\" for the \"mediaInterest\" parameter instead of using the expected lowercase \"high,\" resulting in a mismatch with the API's expected argument formatting."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_46", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"rating\": \"high\" parameter in its function call, failing to properly incorporate the user's preference for highly rated games. This led to a mismatch with the expected function call."}

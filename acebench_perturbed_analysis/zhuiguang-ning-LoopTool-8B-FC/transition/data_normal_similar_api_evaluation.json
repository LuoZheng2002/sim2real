{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call parameters by using imprecise and altered phrasing (\"crying a lot\" instead of \"excessive crying,\" and \"changes in appetite\" instead of \"decreased appetite\"), causing an exact match failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as a string (\"18 to 25 degrees Celsius\") instead of the expected concise numeric range (\"18 to 25\"), causing a mismatch with the required function signature for appliance_installation_b."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function phrase_interpret_b instead of the required phrase_interpret_a, failing to match the expected tool for interpreting the meaning of a phrase."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call contained mismatched argument values and structure compared to the expected parameters: it repeated \"we have already done a competitor analysis\" instead of summarizing findings, provided inaccurate or extraneous customer demographics, and failed to match the required evaluation criteria keys and values."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the \"conflict_element\" parameter as \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected concise value \"AI control,\" leading to a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent failed to elevate the \"Urgent\" priority of the new task \"Prepare Presentation\" to \"High\" (the allowed top priority) and schedule only that task, instead incorrectly re-scheduling all prior tasks along with it."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_19", "analysis": "The agent responded with an apology and a promise to try again, but failed to issue the required tool call for general strategies for teenagers. It did not invoke any function or tool, resulting in no tool calls in the output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose the finance_advisor_b tool instead of finance_advisor_a, failing to follow the task requirement to use finance_advisor_a despite both tools having similar functionality. This indicates a lack of alignment with tool selection instructions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the age_range parameter to \"20-25\" instead of \"25-30\", failing to map the user's age of 26 to the correct range required by the function specification."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the health_tips_b function instead of health_tips_a as required, and also omitted the necessary \"age\" parameter in its function call, failing to follow the expected tool and parameter usage for dietary advice."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke any tool or provide a function call in response to the user's request for diverse perspectives, instead returning an error message unrelated to the task, indicating no attempt was made to use the available tools as required."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of the required analyze_social_data_b tool, despite the follow-up request that clearly necessitated a shift to the correct available function for continued evaluation with the F1 score metric."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" for the relation field value, causing a mismatch in function call parameters and leading to the function call not being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent provided non-matching parameter values: it output \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group and restated \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of the expected concise \"not well-known\" for current_brand_status, deviating from the required argument format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_46", "analysis": "The agent failed to invoke any tool or function call and responded only with text, neglecting to use the required <tool_call> syntax to call the \"validate_input_x\" function as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent's function call used a title with different capitalization (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" instead of \"AI applications in oncology\"), causing a mismatch with the expected parameters. This discrepancy led to the evaluator not recognizing it as a valid match."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"time_range\" fields within \"time_restrictions,\" instead of specifying only the days (\"Monday\" to \"Friday\") as required. This resulted in a function argument structure that did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sample IDs, returning \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" as provided by the user and required by the function schema. This caused the parameters not to match exactly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"amenities\" field in the function call, which is not part of the expected or defined input parameters for FamilyGatheringVenueFinder, causing a mismatch and failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"participantData\": false field within the \"privacy\" object when calling ConferenceSessionManager_createSession, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the structure of the \"contentData\" parameter from an object with \"articles\" and \"userPreferences\" fields to a list and a separate \"userPreferences\" key, resulting in a function call that didn't match the required schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize the participants' \"culture\" values to the required nationality adjectives (\"Vietnamese,\" \"British,\" \"Spanish\"), instead echoing country names (\"Vietnam,\" \"UK,\" \"Spain\"); this mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the gear information inside the top-level function call arguments instead of nesting it within hikingDetails.gear as required by the expected function signature, resulting in a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent's JSON output was incomplete and ended abruptly, likely due to truncation or failure to close braces. This caused a JSON parsing error, preventing the tool call from being processed despite otherwise correct content."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, leading to a mismatch with the strict expected function call structure. This structural inaccuracy caused the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent output malformed JSON lacking closing braces, causing a parsing failure. Additionally, it represented the penalty as a decimal (0.1) instead of the required integer (10), deviating from the user’s specified cancellation policy details."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed indirect employment, omitting a required function call for direct employment. It also did not normalize job role casing as expected. Both direct and indirect employment impacts needed analysis with consistent data formatting."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"winePreferences\" argument in its function calls. The function pairing_cheeseWineMatcher only expects the \"cheese\" parameter, so the additional argument prevented a matching function call and caused evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent returned an invalid JSON for the tool call by omitting the closing braces for the \"arguments\" and the outer object, resulting in malformed JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for the tool call by including an extraneous closing quote and brace at the end of the \"responseTeams\" array, resulting in an unparsable tool argument and preventing execution."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter to the content_moderation_analysis function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected schema and causing the call not to be recognized by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The model incorrectly included extraneous document_id fields in the insurance_claim_verification function call arguments, violating the expected schema which only required document_type for each document; this mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"interactions\": false key in the \"details\" argument, which is not part of the expected function call schema. This mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the function calls as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assigned a severity of 5 to the \"swelling\" symptom instead of the expected severity of 3, resulting in a parameter mismatch for the ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity function call. All other aspects matched expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent made only one function call and used the wrong tool (CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzePhilosophicalThemes) instead of the required two: searching for purpose-driven films and performing a detailed existential analysis with the correct tool."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct function calls and arguments, but used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" as the key in the function call objects, resulting in a schema mismatch and failure to match the expected function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_70", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"contact_number\" field in each applicant_details object, which is not part of the required function schema.

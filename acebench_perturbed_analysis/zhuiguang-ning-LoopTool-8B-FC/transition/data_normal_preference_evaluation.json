{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories, resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported parameters (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and altered the password from \"Jessie90#\" to \"Jessie90#new\", failing to use the correct function signature and required credentials for loginUser."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call because it output \"Town near Austin, TX\" instead of the expected \"a town near Austin, TX\" for UserHomeLocation, indicating insufficient attention to required argument phrasing."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly inferred \"Books\" as the UserPreferredCategories instead of the correct \"Wellness,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters for the addToCart function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of determining or retrieving the actual status (\"Bronze\"), failing to leverage membership information that could affect shipping cost calculation as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserSpendingLimit to 100 instead of retrieving or using the user's actual usual spending limit, which should be 350. This mismatch caused the function call parameters to differ from the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent used the abbreviated location \"San Diego, CA\" instead of the required full form \"San Diego, California\" in the updateUserProfile call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter (\"Gold\") in the calculateShippingCost function call, failing to include all necessary information as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the \"Pending\" status instead of the correct \"Out for Delivery\" status when calling sendOrderUpdate, failing to update the order status as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required HomeLocation parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly modified the user's password by appending \"new\" to it (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of \"Jessie90#\"), resulting in a function call that does not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used \"Indian\" instead of the correct restaurant name \"Indian restaurant\" and incorrectly combined dietary preferences (\"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\") when only \"Gluten-Free\" was expected, resulting in a function call that didn't match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model capitalized the \"OrderName\" value as \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected lowercase \"dinner order,\" causing a mismatch with the strict parameter value expected by the evaluator. This minor casing difference led to the function call not being recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and inappropriately included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a non-null argument, diverging from the expected function call format and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the correct order name \"sushi order\" in the processPayment function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserDietaryPreferences parameter to [\"Gluten-Free\"] instead of the expected [\"None\"], introducing incorrect specificity not mentioned or implied in the user request. This led to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" for the RestaurantName and \"Vegan\" for UserDietaryPreference, instead of extracting \"My favorite Korean joint\" and matching the user's likely \"Spicy\" dietary preference as expected. It failed to ground its arguments in user context."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used the user's stated refund preference (\"Original Method\") and an incorrect refund amount (25.50) instead of the required \"Store Credit\" and the correct amount (350), failing to extract or infer the proper parameters from the available information."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent output \"Low sodium\" (lowercase s) for the UserDietaryPreference parameter instead of \"Low Sodium\" (capital S), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call and the evaluator failing to match them."}

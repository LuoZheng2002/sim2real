{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assigned the relationship for both beneficiaries as \"grandson\" and \"daughter\" rather than mapping both to the correct role of \"grandchild,\" and used capitalized names instead of matching the expected lowercase (\"user,\" \"sister\"), causing the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent included time values formatted with timestamps (\"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z\", \"2023-05-15T23:59:59Z\") instead of the expected date-only format (\"2023-05-01\", \"2023-05-15\"), causing a mismatch with the tool's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect parameter formatting: it failed to use the required \"sourceId\" value (\"1\") and omitted the \"accessProtocol\" field in the \"details\" object. These schema mismatches caused the function call to not match the expected input."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the datetime values in the \"time\" parameter by including 'Z' (indicating Zulu/UTC time), resulting in \"2023-05-28T12:00:00Z\" instead of the expected \"2023-05-28T12:00:00\", which caused a function signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included a timestamp in the end value of the timeRange (\"2024-02-15T23:59:59Z\") instead of matching the expected end format (\"2024-02-15T00:00:00\"), causing a strict mismatch in function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent split the required actions into two separate function calls instead of combining them into a single call with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters, as expected by the tool's interface."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used \"Hawaii Adventure Campaign\" as the campaign title instead of the required title \"Adventure and Travel in Hawaii,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call format. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly capitalized the device names (\"Smartphone\" and \"Laptop\") instead of using lowercase (\"smartphone\", \"laptop\") as required by the expected function parameters, leading to a mismatch and failure to trigger the intended function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in the function call to AccountManager_verifyDocument, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter and altered the expected feature description from \"long beak\" to \"distinctive long beak\", resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature or parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted critical required parameters: the full location (\"123 Market St, San Francisco\") and the \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data. This resulted in a function call that did not match the expected input signature, causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and arguments, but the evaluator likely expected the \"parameters\" key instead of \"arguments\" in the function call object, leading to a mismatch and failed function call recognition."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent's JSON response was incomplete and improperly formatted (missing closing brace), resulting in a parsing error. Additionally, the display content text should be \"latest product video\" rather than \"our latest product video\" to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent included additional preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") not specified by the user, instead of restricting the child's preferences to only \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as requested. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent output \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" for the ingredients, causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile parameter, which is not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch and failed function invocation."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used floating-point values (0.0 and 5.0) for the costAdjustment fields instead of the expected integer values (0 and 5), causing a parameter format mismatch that led to the function call not being recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_75", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"perennials\" preference to false instead of true, conflicting with the user's input that they don't mind perennials. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"timeWindow\" values with a trailing \"Z\" (indicating UTC) and used seconds (\"HH:MM:SSZ\"), whereas the expected format is without \"Z\" and without seconds (\"HH:MM\"). This parameter mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"time_frame\" parameter (\"Immediate\") in the function call, deviating from the expected function signature and causing the call to not match the available tool."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect siteId (\"GreatWall_Beijing\" instead of \"Great Wall Beijing\"), failing to match the expected function call parameters. This mismatch in the string format for siteId led to the evaluator's failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent failed to output a properly formatted JSON object, missing a closing brace at the end, resulting in an invalid tool call that could not be parsed or executed. The issue is purely syntactic, not related to reasoning or content."}

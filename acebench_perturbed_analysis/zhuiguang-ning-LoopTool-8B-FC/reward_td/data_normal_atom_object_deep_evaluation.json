{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"time_range\" for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" parameter, whereas only the \"day\" value was expected. This mismatch in parameter structure caused the function call to not match the required schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sample IDs and failed to nest the parameters under monumentDetails, producing an argument structure that does not match the expected function schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (\"amenities\", \"WiFi\", \"Parking\", \"Catering\", \"Audio-Visual Equipment\", \"Outdoor Space\") in its function call, instead of restricting the call to only the required parameters (\"location\", \"date_range\", \"capacity\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field in the privacy settings of the sessionDetails parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure. This missing field caused the function call to be invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function arguments by omitting the required \"articles\" nesting under \"contentData\" and instead supplied a list directly, resulting in a function call structure mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent failed to generate a properly formatted JSON object for the tool call, omitting the final closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed. This caused the function call to fail despite correct content."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent produced tool call output that was close to correct, but outputted it in a raw JSON block within XML tags rather than as a structured function call; this led to a parsing failure due to invalid formatting, not content."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an extra period in the \"location\" field (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\") which caused a parameter mismatch with the expected function call, leading to evaluation failure despite otherwise correct arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent placed \"themes\" as a top-level argument alongside \"movieDetails\", instead of nesting \"themes\" inside \"movieDetails\" as required by the function signature, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard function call, resulting in its arguments not matching the expected strict schema required for the MarketDashboard_createInteractiveDashboard function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent outputted malformed (truncated) JSON for each tool call, caused by missing closing braces. Additionally, it incorrectly used a decimal (0.1) instead of the specified 10% penalty for same-day cancellation, failing to accurately represent the user's instructions."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, failing to make a second function call for indirect employment as requested. The task required separate analyses for both employment types but only one was performed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"winePreferences\" argument in the function calls instead of strictly matching the expected parameter schema, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call format and thus evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON due to an extraneous quotation mark after the responseTeams array, causing a parsing failure. This syntax error prevented the tool call from being executed despite otherwise correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included a non-existent parameter \"analysis_depth\" in the function call, causing a schema mismatch and failure to match the expected function call for content_moderation_analysis. It should have omitted unsupported arguments and matched the tool's required parameters exactly."}

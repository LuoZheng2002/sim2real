{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"last_name\": \"Smith\" in the \"name_details\" parameter of the function call, resulting in incorrect or incomplete function arguments despite having all necessary information provided by the user."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported parameters \"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\" to the SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call, which is not part of the artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer tool's required parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"schedule\" parameter specifying daily 6:00 AM test runs in the function call, failing to fulfill the scheduling aspect of the user’s request. Only project settings and test_config were included."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent called MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks with correct parameters, but failed to match the required function signature due to not preserving the case sensitivity of the \"genre\" value (\"pop\" instead of \"Pop\"), leading to an unmatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"features\" field within the simulation_parameters, resulting in a function call signature that did not match the expected input schema for stellar_evolution_simulator, and thus the evaluator could not find a matching valid call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary extra parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") to the function calls, causing them not to match the expected function signature and resulting in no valid function calls being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values and formatted the year for the Colosseum query incorrectly (\"100\" instead of \"0100\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the calls as valid."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The model used paraphrased symptom descriptions (\"crying a lot\" instead of \"excessive crying\", \"constant crying\" vs. \"crying a lot\"), which did not exactly match the expected function call's arguments, causing the evaluator to fail the match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call parameters: it used incorrect or less specific values for competitor_analysis, customer_demographics, and evaluation_criteria, and did not align naming and structure with the expected schema, indicating poor extraction and mapping from the provided user information."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the conflict_element as \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected \"AI control,\" causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included all previous tasks plus the new one in the function call, instead of scheduling only the newly requested \"Prepare Presentation\" task with the correct (expected) priority value \"High\" instead of \"Urgent\"."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required function call because it used \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy,\" causing an argument mismatch with the tool schema and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the required \"medium\" for the \"body_type\" parameter, resulting in a mismatched function call according to the strict parameter schema expected by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_27", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"community impact\" as an impact area instead of the valid parameter \"community,\" leading to a mismatch with the function signature and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the health_tips_b function instead of health_tips_a, and also omitted the required age parameter. It failed to match the tool and parameter requirements specified by the original system prompt and user context."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent provided an overly brief problem description instead of the detailed, context-rich description expected for the clarity_guide_b function, failing to include troubleshooting steps already performed and the explicit request for diverse perspectives."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, failing to switch to the correct tool as required by the task context. It also retained extra evaluation metrics instead of limiting to only the F1 score."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct function call name and arguments, but used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker\" for the relation value. This mismatch in the string caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for the age group and \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of just \"not well-known\", resulting in a parameter format mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct function (med_aiArticleGen) and provided appropriate parameters, but the function call's argument key \"focus_area\" does not match the case sensitivity required (\"focus_area\" vs \"focus_area\"), causing the evaluator to reject the output."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the word \"to\" in the \"reviewReason\" field, generating \"to ensure compliance\" instead of the expected \"ensure compliance,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"frequency\" field (\"Weekly\") in the updatedToolSettings for the TechManager_modifyDeployment call; the expected modification was to set only \"method\": \"Email\", causing a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly treated \"Traditional Italian Trattoria\" as a specific restaurant name instead of recognizing it as a cuisine/style request, and used \"near the Colosseum\" as a special request rather than as the location, leading to mismatched function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call but did not use the required function_call JSON schema (with \"parameters\"); instead, it used \"arguments,\" causing the evaluator to not match the function call despite correct content."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent generated and reported incorrect innovation rates for Team Alpha (65.0 instead of the correct 70). It failed to use the provided data to accurately calculate and propagate individual team innovation rates in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_ids (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the required \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", causing a mismatch with the tool's expected parameters and leading to a function call that was not recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent added \"included\" to the \"preferences\" parameter, making it \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast.\" This argument mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter in its travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals function call, omitting necessary details for dynamic pricing and forecasting as specified in the tool's description and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110 instead of the correct $120.5) in the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget call, failing to reference the appropriate option from the provided insurance options in the prior turn."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the returnDate (\"2024-01-03\") in the travelDates parameter when calling travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals, resulting in only a one-way flight search instead of the requested round-trip that matches the user's specified travel dates."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"feedback_type\" in the manage_feedback_collection function call, which is not part of the expected schema, causing the evaluator to reject the output as non-matching."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"existing_conditions\" field for each traveler and did not include the \"duration\" field in coverage_options. This resulted in the function call parameters not matching the expected format, causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extra quotation mark after the number 9 in \"Strategy\": 9\" for both leaders' traits, causing the tool call to fail parsing. This reflects a text formatting error in the function arguments."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assigned a severity value of 5 (instead of the expected 3) to the \"swelling\" symptom in the ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity function call, leading to a mismatch with the required parameters and causing the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"themes\": [\"Existentialism\"] parameter in the PhilosophyCinemaExplorer_findPurposeDrivenFilms call.

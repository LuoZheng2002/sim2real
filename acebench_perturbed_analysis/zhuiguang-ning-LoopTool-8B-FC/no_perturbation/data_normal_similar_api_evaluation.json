{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose the baby_health_check_A function instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the tool focused on persistent vein visibility with associated symptoms as described in the question."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as a string (\"18 to 25 degrees Celsius\") instead of the expected numeric string (\"18 to 25\"), leading to a mismatch with the function's expected argument format and causing function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function (\"phrase_interpret_b\" instead of the required \"phrase_interpret_a\") despite clear precedent and tool descriptions, failing to match the expected function for interpreting a phrase."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call included generic or restated inputs (e.g., repeating \"already done a competitor analysis\") rather than extracting or inferring proper competitor analysis results, and did not match the structure and content required by the tool, resulting in unmatched function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"conflict over AI control\" as the conflict_element argument instead of just \"AI control,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent rescheduled all tasks, including the previously scheduled ones, instead of only adding the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task as required. It also set the new task's priority as \"Urgent\" rather than mapping it to the expected \"High\" priority."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call arguments included slightly altered strings (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors,\" \"have some liquidity\") instead of exactly matching the expected values (\"technology and renewable energy,\" \"maintain some liquidity\"), leading to evaluator mismatch despite equivalent intent."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the age_range parameter to \"20-25\" instead of \"25-30\", failing to align the function call with the user's stated age of 26. This mismatch led to the function call not matching the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a as required, and omitted the user's age parameter. It failed to use the correct function and did not maintain context with the age detail from the prior conversation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call to clarity_guide_b used an insufficient and generic problem description, failing to include the detailed context and user's actions as required by the expected parameters. This incomplete input caused a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, which was the appropriate tool for the requested task. This tool selection error led to no matching function call as required by the test case."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent labeled the relationship as \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" in the function call parameters, causing a mismatch and failure to recognize the intended function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent failed due to mismatched parameter formatting: it used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group and a longer, paraphrased \"current_brand_status\" instead of the expected \"not well-known,\" causing the function call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent capitalized the title parameter (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") instead of using the expected lowercase form (\"AI applications in oncology\"), resulting in a mismatch with the strict parameter value expected by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent used relative date strings (\"March 8\", \"March 22\") instead of converting them to the required ISO format (\"2024-03-08\", \"2024-03-22\") in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_10_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to produce a valid JSON object in its tool call output by omitting the closing braces for the \"arguments\" and the entire object. This malformed JSON prevented successful parsing and tool execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function argument as \"most recent\" instead of the expected \"most-recent\" for feedbackId, causing the evaluator not to recognize the function call as a match. The issue is an argument value mismatch due to improper normalization."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"User\" role in the securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles function call output, omitting a role explicitly mentioned and previously configured, resulting in an incomplete roles setup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" field (with enableAlerts and alertTime) in the arguments for festival_art_schedule_creator, failing to include necessary scheduling alert parameters as specified by the tool’s expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the word \"to\" in the reviewReason field (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the expected value \"ensure compliance,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" in the updatedToolSettings for the communication method change, even though only the \"method\" field (\"Email\") should have been modified; extraneous fields in the function call led to a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call matches the expected content, but likely failed due to a mismatch in argument casing—the tool call uses \"finalize\" (lowercase), while the expected output is \"Finalize\" (capitalized), which caused the evaluator's strict match to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the special_requests field instead of the location field as required by the book_dining function schema, causing a mismatch with the expected function call format and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent generated a report using an incorrect innovation rate (65.0 for Team Alpha) instead of the correct rate (70), failing to accurately use or propagate the original team-specific input data and instead outputting only the previously computed average."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the insurance_cost parameter when calling travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget, despite having access to the insurance quote ($120.5 per person) from a previous step. This resulted in an incomplete and incorrect function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter—including \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\" details—when calling travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema for demand-driven, forecast-based travel deal aggregation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call to travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter, only including \"departureDate,\" thus failing to capture the user's full round-trip request from December 30th to January 3rd."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string, but the expected function call required \"cozy cottage with breakfast\" (without \"included\"). The mismatch in the preferences parameter caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"feedback_type\" parameter and unnecessarily included a \"form_title\" key for the feedback form, leading to a function call that did not match the expected signature for manage_feedback_collection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" as the optionType instead of the required \"installments,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the error."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"existing_conditions\" field for each traveler and failed to include the \"duration\" key in the \"coverage_options,\" resulting in incomplete and mismatched parameters compared to the required function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the team with a transactional leader and incorrectly included it in the function call, violating the tool's requirement to process only transformational leadership teams for innovation rate calculation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extraneous quotation mark after a numerical value (e.g., \"score\": 9\"} instead of \"score\": 9}). This syntax error prevented the tool call from being parsed, despite correct intent and content structure."}

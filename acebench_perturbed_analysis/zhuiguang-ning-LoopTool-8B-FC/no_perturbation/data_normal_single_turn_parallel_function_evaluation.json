{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_2", "analysis": "The agent only issued two function calls (one per model/period combination), instead of all four combinations (both models for both forecast periods). It failed to generate predictions for both timeframes for each model as requested."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_7", "analysis": "The agent formatted function call arguments as \"arguments\" instead of the required \"parameters\" key, causing the evaluator to not recognize the artprint_meshScreenAnalyzer function call despite the values being correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the JSON for the Escher_Shape_Diff_Analyzer call, placing \"analysis_depth\" outside of each comparison pair, causing parsing failure. Additionally, it used \"detailed\" for writingPrompt complexity instead of the required \"advanced\"."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the timePeriod for CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzeSocietalThemes to 2011-2020 instead of restricting it to Inception's year (2010), as required. This mismatch resulted in the function call not matching the expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_19", "analysis": "The agent's first tool call produced malformed JSON by omitting the closing curly brace, resulting in a JSON parsing error and preventing successful invocation of the document_management_store function. This syntactic error is the root cause of the failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly populated the feedbackCollection argument in MarketingCampaign_manageFeedback with detailed feedback data instead of returning empty arrays as required; it should have only specified the feedback sources without their content according to the task requirements."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_26", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"intensity\": \"High\" field in the checkParameters for each ContentAuthenticator_verifyOriginality function call, resulting in parameter mismatches and thus failing to meet the task's specification for originality verification."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"from\" date for the cybersecurity threat evaluation to \"2026-11-01\" (very close to the \"to\" date), instead of using the start of the year (\"2026-01-01\"), thus failing to match the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_29", "analysis": "The agent used \"United States\" instead of \"USA\" for the \"country\" parameter in the \"urban_air_quality_monitor\" function call, causing a mismatch with the required function signature and resulting in failure to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"cardboard boxes\" instead of \"cardboard\" for the packaging material in the FruitSorter_processSortedFruits function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameter and resulting in an unmatched function call error."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included document_id fields in the insurance_claim_verification call, whereas only document_type was expected for each document per the function signature. This mismatch prevented evaluator recognition of an otherwise correct function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"interactions\" field (set to false) in the \"details\" parameter, which was not present in the expected function call schema. This schema mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the function calls as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the severity of \"swelling\" to 5 instead of the expected 3 in the ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity function call, leading to a mismatch with the required parameters and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to specify the \"themes\" parameter (\"Existentialism\") in the PhilosophyCinemaExplorer_findPurposeDrivenFilms call and used the wrong analyzer function for Blade Runner, choosing one focused on choice and morality instead of existential themes as required."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"documentTypes\" parameter (\"passport\") in the VisaInformationManager_getVisaRequirements function call, resulting in an incomplete and non-matching function call despite invoking the correct function with other relevant parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_42", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"event_details\" field in its function call arguments, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to invoke the function as expected."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly grouped all vehicle data into a single function call instead of issuing separate, context-specific calls for each car that include corresponding infrastructure responses. It also omitted required vehicle ID formatting and infrastructure response parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_50", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"terms\" field in the RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation function calls, which was not expected or supported by the function signature, resulting in no match with the evaluator's criteria."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported \"terms\" in the RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation call and omitted the required \"date\" parameter in RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails, leading to schema mismatches that caused the function calls to not match the expected tool signatures."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent misrepresented the parallel circuit by specifying the connection simply as \"from: resistor, to: resistor\" instead of clearly differentiating the two resistors (e.g., \"resistor1\" to \"resistor2\") and indicating the actual parallel configuration required by the prompt."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent outputted a football_venue_management function call with “description”: “turf maintenance” (lowercase), while the expected value was “Turf maintenance” (capitalized). This minor string casing mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_70", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included empty \"contact_number\" fields in each applicant_details object, while the expected function calls only required \"name\" and \"address\". This mismatch in argument structure caused the evaluator to not recognize the calls as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"reverb\" effect's intensity parameter to 0.9 instead of the expected value of 1, and included extraneous parameters (\"apply_time\") not required by the function schema, causing a mismatch in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_81", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"timeOfDay\" to \"night\" for the audio configuration and omitted \"timeOfDay\" for the disk cooling function, instead of using the required \"afternoon\" and \"12:01-18:00\" values, resulting in parameter mismatches with expected function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_84", "analysis": "The agent improperly nested the HomeLightingControl_manageLightSettings settings as a list instead of an object, and incorrectly nested the schedule as a list within this list, resulting in an output schema mismatch that prevented evaluator matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_85", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"reason.details\" field as an object with \"scenario\" and \"examples\" keys, instead of as a list containing an object with only the \"scenario\" key as required by the tool's expected parameter schema."}

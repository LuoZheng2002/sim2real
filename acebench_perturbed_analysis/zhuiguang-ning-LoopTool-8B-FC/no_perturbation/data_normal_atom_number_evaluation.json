{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" were valid parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the provided or relevant values for \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment\" in its function call, instead defaulting them to zero, resulting in an incomplete and incorrect EconomicDevelopmentMetrics request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_33", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"characterName\" parameter (\"Itachi Uchiha\") in its GetCharacterBackground function call, providing only \"animeId\" and \"includeSpoilers,\" which does not match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 10 instead of the required 1200, failing to capture the correct delay value needed to diagnose the user's message reception issue."}

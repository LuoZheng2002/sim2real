{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call, providing only the first name. This incomplete parameterization led to a mismatch with the expected function arguments and caused the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery function call, resulting in a mismatch with the tool’s required signature and failure to match the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a schema mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature. Only the parameters explicitly required by the tool should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary and overly detailed \"details\" information inside the \"protocol\" object, resulting in malformed JSON and a tool call format that does not match the tool's required parameters, ultimately causing a JSON parsing failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"schedule\" parameter specifying daily execution at 6:00 AM, and also returned malformed JSON with an extra closing brace, leading to a parsing error and an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"pop\" instead of \"Pop\" for the genre parameter, resulting in a parameter mismatch and preventing the function call from matching the expected format. The error is due to incorrect capitalization of the genre value."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" parameter in its function call, which did not match the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the function call despite correct core parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"eventTypes\" parameter that is not part of the expected or supported function signature for CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline, resulting in a function call mismatch and failure to execute the task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported \"features\" parameters in the function call, deviating from the expected schema. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a valid match, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") to the function calls that were not part of the expected tool signature, leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure. It should have only specified the \"date_range\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect longitude values for both requested locations and formatted the Colosseum's year as \"100\" instead of the required \"0100,\" resulting in parameter mismatches with the expected function calls and thus evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent formatted the time parameters with a 'Z' suffix, producing timestamps in UTC ISO 8601 format, instead of the expected format without 'Z' or timezone information. This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for each subtask instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters into a single call to the WebSecurity_EncryptionManager function as required."}

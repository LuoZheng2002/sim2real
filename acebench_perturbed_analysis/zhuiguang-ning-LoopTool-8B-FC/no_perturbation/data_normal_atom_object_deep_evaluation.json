{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified both \"day\" and a \"time_range\" for each weekday in \"time_restrictions,\" while the expected function call required only the weekdays without time ranges. This mismatch prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix from the sample IDs, returning \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" as specified in the user input, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"amenities\" parameter in the FamilyGatheringVenueFinder function call, which was not expected or supported according to the benchmark's schema, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"participantData\": false field inside the \"privacy\" object in its function call, failing to fully match the required structure for the privacy parameter according to the expected tool schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the input for ContentOptimizer_applyML by placing \"articles\" and \"userPreferences\" at the same hierarchy level within \"contentData\" instead of nesting them under \"contentData.articles\" and \"contentData.userPreferences\" as required by the function schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize the \"culture\" fields for each participant, returning \"Vietnam\", \"UK\", and \"Spain\" instead of \"Vietnamese\", \"British\", and \"Spanish\" as required, resulting in a parameter mismatch for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information outside of \"hikingDetails\" at the top level of its function call arguments, instead of nesting it within \"hikingDetails\" as required by the function's expected parameter schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was malformed due to a missing closing brace at the end, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed and thus failing the execution of the intended function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent's tool call contained invalid JSON—specifically, it omitted the closing bracket for the \"arguments\" object—resulting in a parsing failure. This serialization error prevented correct function execution, despite forming an otherwise appropriate command."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included a period at the end of the \"location\" field (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} field for the summary widget in the second dashboard's parameters, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call structure. This structural inconsistency caused the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed, incomplete JSON (missing closing braces), causing a parsing error. Additionally, it used a penalty value of 0.1 instead of the required 10, showing an error in interpreting the penalty as a fraction instead of a percentage."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only generated a function call for direct employment and completely omitted analyzing indirect employment, despite the user explicitly requesting analysis for both direct and indirect employment impacts for the specified roles."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"winePreferences\" argument in its function calls to pairing_cheeseWineMatcher, deviating from the expected function signature which only required the \"cheese\" parameter. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the calls as valid matches."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent produced an incomplete and invalid JSON object for the tool call, missing a closing brace and bracket. This caused parsing failure and prevented correct function invocation, despite mostly correct parameter selection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extra quote after the closing curly bracket of the \"responseTeams\" array, causing a parsing error. This syntactic mistake prevented the function call from being executed as intended."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing evaluation failure. The function call parameters were not constrained to the tool's actual interface."}

{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent added extra parameters (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and changed the password value compared to the expected function call. It should have used only the required and expected parameters for loginUser with the original password."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the article \"a\" in \"a town near Austin, TX\" when populating the UserHomeLocation field, resulting in a parameter value mismatch with the expected function call. This deviation caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent used \"Books\" instead of the correct \"Wellness\" for UserPreferredCategories, failing to accurately infer or recall the user's appropriate category preference when composing the addToCart function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" instead of the user's actual membership status \"Bronze\" in the function parameters, failing to leverage the membership benefit as specified and leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"UserSpendingLimit\" to 100 instead of the user's actual spending limit of 350, failing to properly reference or retrieve the user's historical spending limit for the payment process."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent provided \"San Diego, CA\" instead of the required \"San Diego, California\" for the UserHomeLocation parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter in the calculateShippingCost function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to execute the function as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent sent an order update with the status \"Pending\" instead of the required \"Out for Delivery,\" failing to update the order status according to expectations and resulting in no matching function call found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in its processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to process the payment as specified."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly altered the user's password by appending \"new\" to it instead of using the original or provided password, leading to a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and thus failure to correctly process the payment per the tool specification."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the restaurant name to \"Indian\" (missing \"restaurant\") and did not use the user's actual dietary preference (\"Gluten-Free\"), instead defaulting to \"Vegetarian.\" This led to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model incorrectly capitalized the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), resulting in no match with the expected function call due to case sensitivity in argument values. All other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly passed the user's dietary preference as a parameter instead of null, causing a mismatch with the expected function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Sushi Platter\" instead of \"sushi order\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected input and thus failed the evaluator's criteria."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly inferred the user's dietary preference as \"Gluten-Free\" instead of the expected \"None\" when submitting the review, resulting in a mismatched function call. The user only referenced general dietary preferences, not a specific restriction."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the restaurant name \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint,\" and set the dietary preference to \"Vegan\" instead of \"Spicy,\" both mismatching details from the user query and expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used the wrong refund amount (25.50 instead of 350) and the wrong refund preference (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\") in its processRefund call, failing to use the correct details required by the scenario."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The model mismatched the capitalization of the \"UserDietaryPreference\" value (\"Low sodium\" instead of the expected \"Low Sodium\"), resulting in no exact match with the expected tool call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but used a generic placeholder value (\"New Home Location\") instead of the specific required value (\"San Diego, CA\"), failing to accurately process or extract the user's actual new address."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly identified the relationships and roles of the beneficiaries, labeling them as \"Grandson\" and \"Daughter\" instead of \"grandchild\" for both, leading to a parameter mismatch in the function call and failure to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"start\" and \"end\" values in the \"time_frame\" parameter with timestamps (\"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z\") instead of the required date-only format (\"2023-05-01\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the required function signature by using an incorrect sourceId value (\"techdataapi\" instead of \"1\") and omitting the \"accessProtocol\": \"HTTPS\" property in the dataSources details, causing a mismatch with the expected tool call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the time parameters with a trailing \"Z\" (indicating UTC in ISO 8601), while the expected format lacked the \"Z\" and seconds. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included time values with a timezone (\"Z\") and an incorrect end time (\"23:59:59Z\") instead of matching the expected format (no \"Z\", no seconds, end time at \"00:00:00\"). This formatting mismatch caused evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent made two separate function calls for sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption instead of combining both tasks into a single call with both parameter sets as required by the tool's expected usage."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used \"Hawaii Adventure Campaign\" as the campaign title instead of the required \"Adventure and Travel in Hawaii.\" All other parameters match; the failure was due to the incorrect campaign title in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call due to a case mismatch in the \"device_name\" fields (\"Smartphone\" vs. \"smartphone\", \"Laptop\" vs. \"laptop\"), causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as correct."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in its function call and altered the feature name to \"distinctive long beak\" instead of matching the expected \"long beak,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the city (\"San Francisco\") in the location and failed to include the \"historical\": false parameter in the traffic_data, resulting in a mismatched function call that did not meet the required arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and parameters, but failed to format the function call according to the expected \"parameters\" key structure, using \"arguments\" instead. This mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent failed by outputting an incomplete JSON object for the tool call, missing the final closing brace.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent omitted the installation date for the kitchen sensor (\"installationDate\": \"2021-05-10\") in its function arguments, resulting in an incomplete and non-matching function call despite all other information being correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The root cause is the incorrect data type for costAdjustment: the model outputted floats (0.0, 5.0) instead of integers (0, 5) as expected by the evaluator, leading to a mismatch in function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_75", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"perennials\" to false in the \"preferences\" argument, despite the user's explicit statement that they don't mind perennials, which should result in \"perennials\": true.

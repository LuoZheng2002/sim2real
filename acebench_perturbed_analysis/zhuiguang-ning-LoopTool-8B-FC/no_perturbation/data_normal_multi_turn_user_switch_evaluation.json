{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter (\"keyLength\": 256) in the function call arguments, causing the call format to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluator rejection. Only the specified parameters should have been supplied."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\" parameter (\"Immediate\") in its function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter when calling the CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extraneous \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to reject the call as a mismatch with the specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported and unnecessary parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature that only required sourceLanguage, targetLanguage, content, and contentType."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used #008000 for the primary green color instead of the user-requested \"green\" (#00FF00). It failed to honor the user's explicit preference for an exact shade, resulting in a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"museumId\" as \"Louvre\" instead of \"LouvreMuseum,\" and populated \"mustSeeExhibits\" with specific works instead of leaving it empty as required. These mismatches caused the function call to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the function call to TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function arguments and thus failing to fulfill the tool's input specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"targetGroup\" parameter specifying the finance department in the function call, resulting in an incomplete invocation that did not address the user's request to target the finance department."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"group_size\" parameter in its function call, omitting a necessary argument expected by the tool for successful booking."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent's tool call used \"integrationOptions\" as a list of objects, matching the expected structure, but incorrectly lowercased the first letter of \"Valuation summary for properties involved\" in the \"details\" field, causing a mismatch with the evaluator's exact string comparison."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"influence\" parameter in its function call to cultural_event_classical_music_impact, deviating from the expected tool signature and causing a mismatch with the required function parameters."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_0", "analysis": "The agent over-specified parameters by including \"session_time\" and \"interactive_elements,\" which are not part of the expected or supported parameters for vr_experience_create_virtual_tour, resulting in a function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included city-level details in the \"locations\" parameter instead of only listing the countries as specified by the tool's requirements, leading to a function call format mismatch and failure to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output valid tool call content but wrapped it in a non-standard <tool_call> tag, producing output that was not valid JSON and thus could not be parsed by the evaluator, leading to execution failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call in a custom XML-like tag (<tool_call>...</tool_call>) instead of returning a plain, valid JSON object. This formatting error caused JSON parsing to fail, preventing correct tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a fourth week in the training_schedule, while the user specified only three weekly sessions. This mismatch led to a function call that did not align with the expected parameters, causing the evaluator to reject it."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_0", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary extra parameters (\"details\" with \"cuisineType\" and \"meetingType\") to the CNE_EG function call instead of matching the expected, simpler argument structure with only \"country\" and \"context\". This mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter in the DG_BD function call, which did not match the required parameter schema, leading to no recognized matching function call for DG_BD."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function FM_BP but incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed invocation. The error was due to inaccurate extraction or copying of user-provided input values."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\" parameter (\"Immediate\") in its IP_TRO function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This missing parameter caused evaluation failure despite all other details being correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent called the CPA_P function but omitted the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") in its arguments. This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as it did not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId and incorrectly included \"mustSeeExhibits\" in navigationOptions, which should have been empty. These deviations caused the function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") to the CT_I function call that are not part of the required function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching. Only the specified parameters should be used."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"analysisDepth\" parameter in the CDM_CS function call, which was not expected by the function schema, resulting in a mismatch with the required parameters and failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in its TIO_B function call, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected specification despite correctly populating other enhancement settings."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified color preferences, generating a function call with incorrect primary and secondary color values instead of using primaryColor \"#00FF00\" (green) and secondaryColor \"#0000FF\" (blue) as provided by the user."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call mostly matches the expected input, but it lowercased the \"details\" value (\"valuation summary for properties involved\" instead of \"Valuation summary for properties involved\"), causing a strict mismatch in function call parameters and leading to the evaluator's failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"targetGroup\": \"finance department\" parameter in its HRMA_CS function call, omitting the specification of which group the survey targets and thus did not fully satisfy the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call to C_T_E, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to execute the correct booking action."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"influence\" argument (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in its C_E_C_M_I function call, which was not expected or required. The call parameters did not exactly match the expected function signature, causing a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"translationFeatures\" and \"timeOptions\") to the CT_I function call that are not supported by the tool's interface, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_49_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"accessibilityOptions\" parameter in the HE_VT function call, which does not match the expected function signature and prevented successful invocation. Only the accepted parameters from the tool description should have been used."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the G_S_P_T function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected schema, which only requires \"task_name\" and \"priority\" for each task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included city-level details (\"cities\": [\"Berlin\"], \"cities\": [\"Paris\"]) within the \"locations\" argument instead of only specifying countries, causing a mismatch with the expected parameter structure for the DF_CRP function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call in non-JSON format (inside an XML-like <tool_call> tag), which caused a parsing error. The required output was strictly a JSON array/object, not mixed with any markup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted a malformed JSON tool call, likely due to an extra or missing punctuation mark, causing parsing failure. It did not properly format the JSON according to expected standards for function calling."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent included an extra (fourth) week in the training_schedule parameter when only three weeks were provided by the user, resulting in a function call that did not precisely match the expected call with three weeks."}

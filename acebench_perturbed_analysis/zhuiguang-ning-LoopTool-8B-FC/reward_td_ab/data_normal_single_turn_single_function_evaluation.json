{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"eclipseType\": \"total\" parameter in its NSA_EA function call, failing to specify that only total solar eclipses are of interest, which resulted in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the relationships and names for the beneficiaries, using \"User\" as a literal name and \"Grandson\"/\"Daughter\" as relationships, rather than the expected normalized roles (\"grandchild\") and case-insensitive names (\"user\", \"sister\"). This prevented a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent outputted the time_frame values in full ISO 8601 timestamp format (including time and \"Z\"), while the expected format was date-only (YYYY-MM-DD). This discrepancy caused the evaluator not to match the function call, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call because it used \"sourceId\": \"API\" instead of the required \"sourceId\": \"1\" in the dataSources parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_10", "analysis": "The agent used \"living room\" instead of the expected \"living_room\" for the room_id field, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in a failure to match the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"includeHistoricalData\" parameter not accepted by the M_W function, and formatted the timeRange \"end\" with the wrong timestamp (\"23:59:59Z\" instead of \"00:00:00\"). This caused the function call to not match exactly."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent called the function travelAdDesigner_createCampaign_1 instead of AD_C, failing to use the required tool as per the benchmark, despite both tools having nearly identical descriptions. This indicates inadequate function selection based on the prompt."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent mismatched the expected device_name casing (\"Smartphone\" vs \"smartphone\", \"Laptop\" vs \"laptop\"), causing its function call not to match the strict evaluator requirements, even though other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter (\"immediate\") in its AM_D function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature. This caused the evaluator to treat the call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in its SC_F function call and used a verbose common name instead of the general category \"bird,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data and did not specify the city (\"San Francisco\") in the store_details location, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent provided a placeholder (\"base64 encoded string of the image data\") for the imageData parameter instead of using the actual base64 string from the user's message, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only included one digital display in the \"branding\" section instead of the required two, failing to fulfill the user's request for two LED displays showing the latest product video."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter the child's preferences to only include the ones mentioned in the user query (\"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\"), instead including additional irrelevant preferences (\"Drawing\" and \"Music\") in the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_53", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly nested \"creditHistoryProviders\" and \"analysisPeriod\" inside \"userData\" rather than at the top level of the parameters object, resulting in a JSON structure incompatible with the expected tool schema and causing a parsing failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" in the ingredients list, resulting in a parameter mismatch that prevented function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_58", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's unavailability on Wednesday and incorrectly included Wednesday in the \"weekdays\" schedule_availability, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent made a function call to BRE_R with correct parameters, but the function call format did not match the expected schema (incorrect argument nesting and field names), leading to evaluator mismatch despite semantically correct intent."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"installationDate\" field for each sensor in its ET_QM function call, failing to include all necessary parameters as specified in the user's request and the tool's expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call and arguments but formatted \"costAdjustment\" as 0.0 and 5.0 (floats) instead of 0 and 5 (integers), causing a mismatch with the expected parameters format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent attempted to call the correct function (RA_MO) with accurate parameters, but used floating-point values (1000.0, 2000.0) for the budget instead of the required integers (1000, 2000), causing a parameter type mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent set the timeWindow end value to \"2020-03-02T23:59:59\" instead of the expected \"2020-03-02T23:59:00\", resulting in a mismatch and no function call recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_83", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extraneous \"timeFrame\" parameter in the CM_M function call that is not part of the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call format."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contained malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace, resulting in a syntax error that prevented successful parsing and function execution.

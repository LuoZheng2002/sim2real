{"id": "normal_atom_bool_5", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the \"include_legal_requirements\" parameter, which is not part of the ERA function's expected parameters. This caused the function call format to not match, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\": false parameter in the TMA_S function call, failing to specify the balance with work commitments as expected by the task. This made the output not match the necessary schema for evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_11", "analysis": "The agent included \"noise_level\": \"loud rattling noise\" instead of the expected \"loud rattling,\" causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and leading to the evaluator being unable to match the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (CES_E) but omitted required parameters (\"include_attachment\" and \"encryption_level\"), resulting in an incomplete and invalid function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"provide_indoor_options\" in the HWA function call; only \"hiking_location\" is allowed, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_23", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported and extraneous parameters (\"pattern_detection\", \"include_visualization\", \"focus_on_physical_training\") to the ETTP function call instead of only using the required \"training_routine_data\" parameter, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_32", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported parameter \"consider_temperature\" to the CRBOW function call. The tool only expects the \"city\" parameter, so the function call did not match and was not executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, and include_device_usage parameters to true instead of false as required by the expected input, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_46", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the \"offers_gluten_free\": true parameter required by the user's request, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not meet the specified dietary needs."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameter \"include_indoor_suggestions\" (set to false) in the WWC function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"industry\" parameter to \"technology startup\" instead of the accepted value \"technology\" for the TR_T function, causing the function call to not match the expected parameters."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent failed to include \"excessive crying\" as an additional symptom and did not phrase \"baby_behaviors\" as \"constant crying and decreased appetite,\" leading to a function call that did not match the expected parameters for B_H_C_B."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call included parameter names and values that did not exactly match the expected schema (e.g., different evaluation_criteria key names, inconsistent capitalization/casing, and excessive detail in \"customer_demographics\"), preventing evaluator matching. Precise adherence to required parameter formats is necessary."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the required \"AI control\" for the conflict_element parameter, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent called the outdated \"task_schedule_a_1\" function with all four tasks instead of calling \"T_S_A\" with only the new task (\"Prepare Presentation\") with the correct priority mapping (\"Urgent\" to \"High\"), as required."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_20", "analysis": "The agent called an incorrect function (\"vlookup_step_guide_1\") instead of the required \"V_S_G\" function to provide the step-by-step VLOOKUP guide, failing to use the function that the benchmark specified as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call failed to match due to minor paraphrasing differences in argument values (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" vs. \"technology and renewable energy\" and \"have some liquidity\" vs. \"maintain some liquidity\"), causing a strict evaluator mismatch despite correct intent and chosen function."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent used \"medium build\" instead of the required \"medium\" for the body_type parameter, causing a schema mismatch with the expected function call and preventing proper tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong tool (health_tips_b) instead of the expected H_T_A tool, and it omitted the critical user attribute \"age\" in its function call parameters, leading to a mismatch in both tool choice and required arguments."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent provided only a minimal problem description to the C_G_B tool, omitting critical context and additional details that clarify what steps have already been taken, resulting in an incomplete and insufficient function call compared to the expected enriched input."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed the target values as a separate list instead of associating them with each dataset entry. The function call format did not match the expected structure, causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a valid call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"analyze_social_data_a\" instead of the expected \"A_S_D_B\" function for F1 score evaluation, and failed to adjust its parameters to use the required tool with the specified metric, despite \"A_S_D_B\" being available and more appropriate."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong function, calling poetry_analysis_b instead of the required P_A_A function, despite P_A_A matching the task and being the expected tool for analyzing the poem's relation to Han dynasty music culture."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent output the relation as \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" and added extraneous detail (\"causes tension\") to the status field, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"age_group\" value (\"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\") and the \"current_brand_status\" (\"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of the expected \"not well-known\"), causing a mismatch with the required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The model's function call arguments do not exactly match the expected schema, specifically in field capitalization (\"AI Applications in Oncology\" vs. \"AI applications in oncology\"), causing the evaluator to reject the output as non-matching."}

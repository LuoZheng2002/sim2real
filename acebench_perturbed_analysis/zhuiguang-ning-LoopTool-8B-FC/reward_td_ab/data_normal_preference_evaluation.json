{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required security question and answer parameters in its function call to P, omitting information explicitly requested by the user and necessary for successful password reset."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" for UserPreferredCategories, failing to exactly match the parameter value expected by the function signature. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted required parameters (\"userPreferredLoginTime\" and \"loginFrequency\") in the function call to U and used an incorrect password. It failed to fully capture and encode user-specific login preferences as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the article \"a\" in \"a town near Austin, TX\" for the UserHomeLocation parameter, resulting in a minor mismatch with the expected function call arguments and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books\" instead of \"Wellness,\" failing to use the user's actual preference and resulting in a mismatched function call. This discrepancy caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the correct UserMemberStatus value (\"Bronze\") in its function call, instead using the generic value \"Standard,\" thus not reflecting the user's actual membership status as required for accurate shipping cost calculation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for \"UserSpendingLimit\" (100 instead of the correct 350), failing to align with the user's actual usual spending limit. All other parameters were correct, but the wrong limit value caused the mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"San Diego, CA\" instead of the required \"San Diego, California\" for UserHomeLocation, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call arguments and causing the evaluator to not recognize the output as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter in the SC function call, resulting in an incomplete and non-matching function call signature compared to the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call to UP omitted required fields (\"UserLanguage\", \"UserTimeZone\", \"UserBirthday\") expected by the evaluator, providing only the fields mentioned in the user request. This incomplete payload led to a mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function (\"OU\") but supplied an incorrect value for the \"OrderStatus\" parameter (\"Pending\" instead of the expected \"Out for Delivery\"), failing to update the user with the latest status as requested."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Shellfish-Free\" in the \"UserDietaryPreference\" parameter, which does not match the expected function call that only included \"Gluten-Free\", leading to a failed match with the benchmark's expected input."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function \"P\" but omitted required parameters \"UserLoyaltyStatus\" and \"HomeLocation\" in the function payload. It failed to retrieve and include user profile information necessary for applying discounts, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent used a password value \"Jessie90#new\" instead of the provided \"Jessie90#\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function arguments. All other parameters were correct, but the altered password caused the function call to not match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the function call to P, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call and failure to meet the tool's input requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used \"Indian\" instead of the full restaurant name \"Indian restaurant\" in the MI function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused function call evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent's function call to P omitted required parameters \"UserLoyaltyStatus\" and \"HomeLocation,\" which were explicitly requested by the user and expected by the evaluator. This led to no match with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and added an unnecessary parameter (\"UserDietaryPreference\":\"Vegan\" instead of null), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the expected order identifier \"sushi order\" for the OrderName parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and failing the test."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly populated the \"UserDietaryPreferences\" field with [\"Gluten-Free\", \"Dairy-Free\"] instead of the expected [\"None\"], introducing undesired dietary preferences not mentioned by the user, leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the user-specified restaurant name (\"My favorite Korean joint\") and dietary preference (\"Spicy\"), instead hallucinating a different restaurant and incorrectly using \"Vegan\" as the dietary preference. This led to a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name \"R\" but provided incorrect arguments: it used the wrong refund amount (25.50 instead of 350) and the wrong refund preference (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\"). This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected output."}

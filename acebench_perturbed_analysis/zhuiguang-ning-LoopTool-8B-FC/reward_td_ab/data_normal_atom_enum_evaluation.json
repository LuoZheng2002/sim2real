{"id": "normal_atom_enum_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported parameter (\"investmentHorizon\": \"Short Term\") in the SIP_TSI function call that does not exist in the available tool’s specification, causing a mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_7", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (SNE_MS) with appropriate arguments but omitted the required \"contactMethod\": \"Email\" parameter, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_15", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"recipeComplexity\" parameter (\"Easy\") in the NRC_LCR function call, which does not accept that argument, causing the function call to mismatch the expected tool schema. Only \"calorieLimit\" and \"cookingTime\" should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_22", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"outputDetail\":\"Summary\" parameter in the TAT_MI function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_34", "analysis": "The agent called the correct EL_NE function with the right location but failed to include the required \"eventType\": \"Concert\" parameter, resulting in an incomplete and unmatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"ratingThreshold\": \"good\" parameter in its GF_UIFG function call, failing to specify that only well-rated Sci-Fi games should be recommended, as clearly requested in the user's prompt."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_43", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"Eastern Standard Time\" instead of the required abbreviation \"EST\" for the timezone parameter, resulting in a function call parameter mismatch and the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_enum_46", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (GD_NGBI) with the appropriate interest (\"Strategy\") but failed to include the required \"rating\": \"high\" parameter, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected output."}

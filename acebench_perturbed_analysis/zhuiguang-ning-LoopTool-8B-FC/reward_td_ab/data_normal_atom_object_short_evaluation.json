{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_1", "analysis": "The agent used the function education_schedule_student_events_1 instead of the correct function E_S_S_E, despite both offering identical scheduling capabilities. The error stems from selecting the wrong function name, not from the function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent added extra unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") to the SA_HI function call instead of only using the parameters specified in the tool description and expected answer, resulting in a mismatch and failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_14", "analysis": "The agent called the function security_generate_alias_1 instead of the correct S_G_A tool, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call despite supplying the correct parameters. The failure was due to selecting the wrong function name."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"schedule\" parameter specifying the daily 6:00 AM test run time, omitting a key part of the user's instruction to automate and schedule the tests as requested."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent provided the genre as \"pop\" (lowercase) instead of \"Pop\" (title case), resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call, which required an exact match in case sensitivity."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_23", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function, using \"presentation_add_background_music_1\" instead of \"P_A_B_M\" as required, despite both having similar descriptions and the expected call specifying \"P_A_B_M\". This indicates a failure in function selection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"eventTypes\" argument in the CTG_T function call, which is not part of the expected or supported parameters, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the \"football_venue_management_1\" function instead of the required \"F_V_M\" function, failing to use the expected tool even though both provide the same capabilities."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_31", "analysis": "The agent called the function \"olympics_get_top_athletes_1\" instead of the available and expected function \"O_G_T_A\" as specified in the tools list, despite both providing the same functionality, resulting in a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra simulation features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") in the function call arguments, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected S_E_S function signature. The function should only receive the specified cloud and simulation parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") not required by the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format and failure to match the evaluator's criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used the wrong function (TimeTravelGeocoder_getAddress_1) instead of the required TTG_A function, and also did not match the expected parameter formats (e.g., slight differences in coordinates and date formatting for year 100)."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made a single batch call with multiple patient IDs using \"hospital_record_fetch_1\" instead of issuing individual calls (one per patient) to the \"H_R_F\" function as expected. It failed to match the required function granularity and selection."}

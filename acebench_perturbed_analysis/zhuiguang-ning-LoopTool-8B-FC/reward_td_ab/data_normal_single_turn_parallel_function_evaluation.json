{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"interactions\" field in the \"details\" argument for each TT_VT function call, deviating from the expected schema which only required \"settlements\" and \"routes.\" This schema mismatch prevented successful function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent failed to call the precise RBRS_BS function with the required bite details and symptoms, using a similar but incorrect function (ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity_1) instead, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent called the PCE_PDF function without specifying the required \"themes\" parameter (missing \"Existentialism\"), resulting in an incomplete and invalid function call for retrieving purpose-driven films with existential themes."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent added an extraneous \"advisoryDetails\" parameter to the CTA_TA function call, which is not part of the expected input signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the tool call properly."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_4", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (CDA_VD) but did not wrap the parameters inside a \"votingContext\" object as required by the function's expected input schema, resulting in a schema mismatch and failed execution."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included detailed \"time_range\" values within the \"time_restrictions\" instead of specifying only the weekdays as required; the function call arguments did not match the expected schema, causing a mismatch for the C_I_M_S tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function signature by omitting the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper object and used \"sampleID\" values (\"A\", \"B\") instead of the complete identifiers (\"Sample A\", \"Sample B\"), resulting in a function call format mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_13", "analysis": "The agent used the function \"publicSpeaking_coach_1\" instead of the required \"S_C\" function, despite both offering similar capabilities. The root issue is failure to select the correct tool \"S_C\" as specified in the ground truth."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_14", "analysis": "The agent called the function festivalEventsManager_createVirtualExperience_1 instead of the required EM_VE function, despite both having identical descriptions. It failed to select the correct, expected tool name (EM_VE) for this task."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_15", "analysis": "The agent called the function GlobalCulturalEventPlanner_1 instead of the required GCEP function, despite both offering similar capabilities. This indicates a failure to select the correct tool as specified by the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field within the privacy object in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema for the CSM_S tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_17", "analysis": "The agent called the function GeoArchDesign_collaborateProject_1 instead of the required GAD_P function, despite both having the same capability; it failed to select the correct tool as specified in the available tools and expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra irrelevant parameter (\"session_length\") in the function call to M_E_P_G, which caused the call not to match the tool's expected input schema and resulted in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was malformed and incomplete: it lacked the final closing braces needed to properly terminate the JSON object, causing a parsing error and failure to execute the function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete and missing the final closing braces, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. The root cause is a truncation or formatting error that left the output syntactically invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent selected the slower comfortControl_manageWhiteNoise_1 tool instead of the faster, preferred C_WN tool for this task, and outputted a tool call under the wrong name, contrary to the expected function usage."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"capacity\" parameter in the CAC_CP function call, which did not match the expected parameters, resulting in no matching function call being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_29", "analysis": "The agent called \"travelPlanner_queryTrainSchedules_1\" instead of the expected \"P_TS\" function, despite both having the same intended functionality. It failed to select the correct tool as specified by the ground truth, resulting in a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent called the wrong function, using PhilosophyCinemaAnalyzer_analyzePhilosophicalThemes_1 instead of the required PCA_PT function, even though both serve a similar analytical role. This indicates a failure to select the specific function expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object for the summary widget in the second dashboard configuration, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected parameters and thus was not considered a valid invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent outputted an invalid JSON for tool calls due to a missing closing brace, causing a parsing error. Additionally, it represented the \"penalty\" value as 0.1 (float) instead of the required integer 10, leading to incorrect function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only called the function once for direct employment, omitting a second required call for indirect employment, despite the question explicitly asking for both direct and indirect impact analysis."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"winePreferences\" object in the P_WM function call arguments, which does not match the expected function call signature. The function should only have provided the \"cheese\" parameter with its characteristics."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent generated malformed JSON due to an extra closing quotation mark after the responseTeams array, leading to a parsing error and preventing valid tool invocation. The tool call was otherwise correctly structured."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, undocumented parameter \"analysis_depth\" in its C_M_A function call, which didn't match the expected function signature and caused the evaluator to reject the function call as invalid."}

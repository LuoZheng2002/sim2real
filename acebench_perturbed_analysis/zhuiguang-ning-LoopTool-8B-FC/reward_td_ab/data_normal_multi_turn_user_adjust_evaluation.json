{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_17_2", "analysis": "The agent called the function CustomerDataBackupManager_cancelBackup_1 instead of the required CDBM_B function, failing to use the correct tool as specified in the expected answer for canceling the backup job."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_13_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the translateAndSynthesize_runTranslation_1 function instead of the required AS_T function and failed to include the specified speech synthesis options (female voice, natural intonation, standard rate) in its function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called \"PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1\" instead of the required \"PFM_F\" function, despite both having similar descriptions. This demonstrates a failure to select the correct tool for feedback analysis as specified in the available functions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only created the new \"Supervisor\" role inheriting from \"Admin\" but failed to include the previously discussed \"Admin\" and \"User\" roles in the MAPI_UR function call, resulting in an incomplete setup of user roles."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent called an incorrect function (securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles) to define roles, instead of the required MAPI_AC function which configures both roles/permissions and enables auditing as specified in the user's request and the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_29_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted \"per night\" from the \"budget\" field when invoking HBS_H, providing \"$150\" instead of the expected \"$150 per night,\" resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified location \"Trastevere\" and instead used the broader \"Rome\" as the location argument in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field to the updatedToolSettings argument, causing the function call to not exactly match the expected parameters. Only the \"method\": \"Email\" should have been included for the communicationModule update."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"to ensure compliance\" (with \"to\") as the reviewReason instead of matching the expected \"ensure compliance,\" causing a parameter mismatch that led to the function call not being recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call argument for the \"agenda\" field used lowercase (\"finalize and sign the contract\") instead of the expected capitalized form (\"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter comparison."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget IDs (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the expected \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\", causing the function call argument mismatch and failure to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the \"special_requests\" field instead of using it as the \"location\" parameter, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call schema for B_D."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent output the correct information but failed to match the required function call parameter structure, using \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" as specified for GTS_SM, leading to a schema mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"alertTime\" in the notifications field to 10 instead of the expected 30, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to produce an exact function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (DA_D) with appropriate destination and dateRange, but omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (with \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\" keys), leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to satisfy the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The model's function call included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences parameter instead of the expected \"breakfast,\" causing it to fail an exact match check. The agent was over-literal with user input rather than normalizing to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"returnDate\" (\"2024-01-03\") in the \"travelDates\" parameter when invoking the DA_FD function, providing only the departureDate despite the user specifying a round-trip request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used an insurance_cost of 110 instead of the correct $120.5 per person for insurance, as provided in the prior system message listing insurance options. It failed to select the appropriate insurance quote referenced in the context."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter (\"overall_experience\") in the function call to M_F_C, which was not expected per the schema, causing a mismatch with the required arguments and leading to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out non-transformational leader teams before calling TIM_IR, including data for the transactional-led team Gamma, which violates the function's intended input constraint of only transformational leadership teams."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call: it did not include \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and omitted the \"duration\" field in \"coverage_options\", resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"monthly installments\" as the optionType instead of the expected \"installments\" in the repaymentOptions for both debts, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call parameter structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete due to a missing closing brace, resulting in invalid JSON. This caused a parsing failure, as the tool could not process the malformed input. The agent should ensure it outputs well-formed, complete JSON."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The failure was due to formatting argument keys incorrectly—using \"workshop_details\" and \"candidates\" instead of the expected \"workshop_details\" and \"candidates\" at the top level under \"parameters\". The model wrapped arguments under an extra layer, not matching the required function call schema."}

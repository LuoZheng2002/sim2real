{"id": "agent_multi_step_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the bait function \"login_food_platform_1,\" which was explicitly prohibited. The expected behavior was to only use the allowed functions to accomplish the task, avoiding any bait or decoy functions."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_6", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the bait function \"add_food_delivery_order_1\", which is explicitly disallowed. It should have only used the valid \"A_F_D_O\" function for ordering, as specified in the available tools and ground truth expectations."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the bait function delete_message_1 instead of using D_M for message deletion as required. It did not check for message capacity nor retrieve the correct latest message ID prior to deletion, violating tool selection and deletion protocol."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the bait function \"add_food_delivery_order_1\", which is explicitly disallowed. It should have used only the legitimate order function \"A_F_D_O\" to place the food order, avoiding forbidden or baited APIs."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the bait function \"view_messages_between_users_1\" despite the presence of the preferred and allowed \"V_M_B_U\" function, violating constraints and causing the evaluation to fail due to unauthorized function usage."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_11", "analysis": "The agent deleted message ID 3 (Grace’s original request) instead of the most recent message (ID 4), violating the instruction to delete the most recent message when the inbox is full before sending the reply. This caused the incorrect final inbox state."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_14", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly tried to log in to the food delivery platform as Frank instead of Eve, repeatedly using the wrong credentials, and never proceeded to place the correct order, delete messages if needed, or notify Frank as instructed."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to log in to the food platform as Frank with Eve's password, instead of logging in as Eve and placing the order. It failed to proceed with the tasks due to this mistaken identity handling."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly tried to log in to the food platform as Frank instead of as Eve, despite Eve's credentials being available. As a result, it failed to place the order and did not proceed with subsequent required actions."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_17", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly attempted to place the food order using Frank’s account (with the wrong password), rather than using Eve’s own account as required. It also failed to check message capacity and did not send the required message to Frank after purchase."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_18", "analysis": "The agent sent the \"See you tomorrow\" message multiple times, resulting in duplicate messages in the inbox. It failed to check if the message was successfully sent before retrying, leading to an extra message being stored."}
{"id": "agent_multi_step_19", "analysis": "The agent erroneously called the bait function delete_message_1 instead of only using the correct D_M function for message deletion, violating the restriction against bait function usage and resulting in an invalid world state."}

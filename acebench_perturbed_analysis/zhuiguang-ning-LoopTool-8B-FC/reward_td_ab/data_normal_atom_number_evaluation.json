{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"analysisDepth\" parameter in its STE function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as matching. Only \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\" were expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"minRating\": 4 parameter in the LFDS function call, so it did not specify the search for highly-rated restaurants as requested in the user's query."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent omitted the values for \"serviceSectorGrowth\" and \"foreignInvestment,\" providing zeros instead of the correct values, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected parameters for the EDM tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent called the MRC function with an unrealistically low receptionDelay value (5) instead of the expected 1200, failing to infer the actual or plausible message delay from the user’s complaint before invoking diagnostic tools."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"eclipseType\": \"total\" parameter in its function call, resulting in an incomplete request that does not specifically target total solar eclipses as asked in the user query."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent used the beneficiaries' relationships as \"Grandson\" (user) and \"Daughter\" (sister) instead of mapping both to \"grandchild\" as expected; it also capitalized names instead of using lowercase, causing parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent included a time frame with timestamps (including time and \"Z\"), while the expected function call required only the date (\"YYYY-MM-DD\"). This mismatch in argument format led to no matching function call being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent used \"API\" as the sourceId instead of the required \"1\", failing to match the parameter structure expected by the function, which caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"includeHistoricalData\" parameter not present in the function schema, and used a time format with 'Z' and a different 'end' time than expected. These mismatches caused the function call to fail schema validation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent selected the correct function name and parameters, but used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\" as the top-level key, causing a schema mismatch with the expected function call format. This led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent attempted to call the correct function with appropriate arguments, but failed to match the expected function call syntax or output format required by the evaluator—likely due to format discrepancies or not following the required output structure exactly."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in its AccountManager_verifyDocument function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected input schema and causing the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required classificationPeriod parameter and slightly altered the feature description (\"distinctive long beak\" instead of \"long beak\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"historical\": false parameter in traffic_data and the \"San Francisco\" part of the address, resulting in a function call that does not fully match the required parameters for store_setup_manager."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent correctly chose the intended function and parameters but did not match the exact parameter keys or formatting expected (e.g., wording in \"imageData\"). This mismatch prevented the evaluator from recognizing the function call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only included one digital display in the \"branding.digitalDisplays\" array instead of two as requested, resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent included extra preferences (\"Drawing\" and \"Music\") not mentioned by the user in the child profile, deviating from the input. This mismatch led to a non-exact function call argument, causing the evaluator to reject the model's output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_53", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool and compiled the right data, but generated malformed JSON for the tool call, truncating the object and omitting the closing braces. This syntax error prevented successful parsing and execution."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used the function name correctly, but provided an ingredient value of \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves,\" leading to a parameter mismatch and failed function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_58", "analysis": "The agent set \"weekdays\" to include Wednesday instead of omitting it as specified by the user, resulting in an incorrect schedule_availability parameter that did not match the user's stated availability. This caused the function call not to match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The root cause is that the model called BookRecommendationEngine_fetchRecommendations instead of the uniquely named BookRecommendationEngine_fetchRecommendations_1, as required by the available tools list, resulting in a function name mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"installationDate\" for the kitchen sensor (\"sensorId\": \"001\") in its function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to register no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and arguments, but formatted the function call using a \"tool_call\" wrapper instead of the expected syntax, resulting in its output not matching the evaluator's required function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent correctly constructed the function call but failed because the arguments \"min\" and \"max\" in the \"budget\" object used floats (1000.0, 2000.0) instead of integers (1000, 2000), causing the call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and parameters, but the timeWindow values were formatted incorrectly (included \"Z\" and extra seconds), causing a mismatch with the expected function call and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"time_frame\" in its function call, which did not match the expected function signature, resulting in no matching function call detected."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect siteId value (\"Great Wall Beijing Segment\" instead of \"Great Wall Beijing\") in the function call, causing it to not match the expected function call despite using the correct tool and parameters otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent generated a malformed JSON object by omitting the final closing brace, leading to a JSON parsing failure. This serialization error prevented the tool call from being executed despite otherwise correct content."}

{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent used the category \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods\" in the addToCart function call, causing a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent called loginUser with only email and password, omitting the required userPreferredLoginTime and loginFrequency parameters that were necessary for a complete, expected login function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name (\"updateUserProfile\") but did not match the required function call schema exactly—specifically, it used \"Town near Austin, TX\" instead of the expected \"a town near Austin, TX\" for UserHomeLocation, causing an argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books\" instead of the expected \"Wellness\", failing to align with user preferences or contextual cues from the question. This mismatch caused the function call not to be recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_14", "analysis": "The agent omitted required profile fields (UserTimeZone and UserBirthday) in its updateUserProfile call and failed to include all necessary parameters as expected, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent used \"Platinum\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the expected \"Bronze,\" leading to a mismatch. Additionally, although the function name matches, an argument discrepancy prevented recognition of the call as correct by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserSpendingLimit\" to 100 instead of the user's actual usual limit of 350, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected processPayment call and causing the function call not to match."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"San Diego, CA\" instead of the required \"San Diego, California\" for the UserHomeLocation field, causing its function call arguments to not match the expected format and failing the evaluator's exact matching criteria."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required UserMemberStatus parameter when calling calculateShippingCost, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected signature and thus failed to execute as needed."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent omitted required user profile fields (\"UserLanguage\", \"UserTimeZone\", and \"UserBirthday\") in its updateUserProfile call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function parameters and causing the evaluator not to recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent sent the order update with an incorrect OrderStatus (\"Pending\" instead of the required \"Out for Delivery\"), resulting in a function call that did not match the expected state update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly combined multiple dietary preferences instead of updating the menu item with only the single \"Gluten-Free\" preference as expected, resulting in a function call argument mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in its processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with expected arguments and a failed tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect new password (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of \"Jessie90#\"), causing its function call not to match the expected parameters and resulting in no matching function call for updateUserProfile. The essential error is a parameter value mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in its processPayment call and did not match the exact casing for \"OrderName.\" As a result, its function call did not match the expected parameters and failed evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent specified the \"RestaurantName\" as \"Indian\" instead of the correct \"Indian restaurant,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent used an uppercase \"OrderName\" field instead of the expected lowercase \"orderName\" (\"dinner order\"), leading to a mismatch and failure to match the function call parameters exactly as required."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used \"Japanese restaurant\" instead of the precise restaurant name \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant,\" and incorrectly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter, which should be null. Parameter values did not strictly match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the required order name \"sushi order,\" causing the function call not to match the expected parameters despite otherwise correct information. This mismatch led to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"Gluten-Free\" for UserDietaryPreferences when the expected value was [\"None\"], resulting in a parameter mismatch. This caused the function call not to match exactly with the expected, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the restaurant name and used \"Vegan\" instead of \"Spicy\" for the dietary preference, leading to a mismatched function call that did not satisfy the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name but provided incorrect parameter values for Amount and UserRefundPreference, issuing a $15.99 refund to Original Method instead of the expected 350 (units/currency) refund to Store Credit, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Nut-Free\" instead of the user's actual dietary preference, \"Low Sodium,\" when calling addMenuItem, leading to a mismatch in function arguments and failure to align with the user's request."}

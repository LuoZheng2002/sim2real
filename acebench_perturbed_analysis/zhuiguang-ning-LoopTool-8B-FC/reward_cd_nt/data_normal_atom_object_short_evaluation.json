{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call arguments, providing only the first name (\"Helena\"), even though both were explicitly given by the user and expected by the tool input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the function call to SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter (\"printTime\") in its function call that is not defined in the expected tool schema, causing a mismatch with the required function signature and leading to evaluation failure despite the relevant settings being correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"schedule\" parameter (with time and frequency) in its function call, thereby not fulfilling the user's request to schedule daily test runs at 6:00 AM."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent called \"MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks\" instead of the available tool \"MusicSearchEngine_queryTracks_1\"; the function name did not match any provided tool, causing the evaluator to reject the function call despite otherwise correct arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported feature parameters (\"features\": [\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\"]) in the function call. This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature, leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary arguments (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") not required or accepted by the tool signature, resulting in a function call format mismatch and failure to invoke the intended tool correctly."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values and did not zero-pad the year \"100\" to \"0100\" in the function arguments, resulting in parameter mismatches and evaluation failure. Precise coordinate and date formatting were required but not followed."}

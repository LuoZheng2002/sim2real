{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent omitted \"excessive crying\" from additional_symptoms and did not fully specify baby_behaviors as \"constant crying and decreased appetite,\" resulting in insufficient detail and lack of string match with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct parameter structure and normalized values as expected: it did not provide detailed competitor analysis, provided extra or mismatched customer demographics, and mismatched naming/values in evaluation criteria, resulting in function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function name (\"plot_summary_generator_d\") but the argument \"conflict_element\" used \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected value \"AI control.\" This mismatch caused the function call to not match exactly for evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly resubmitted all tasks—including those previously scheduled—instead of adding only the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task. It also used the \"Urgent\" priority instead of normalizing it to \"High\" as expected, failing to match the required API call structure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent formatted and selected the correct parameters but failed to match the required tool name exactly; it omitted using finance_advisor_a from the tool list, possibly due to improper function call formatting or not referencing the precise tool identifier."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"body_type\": \"medium build\" instead of the expected \"medium,\" causing its function call arguments to not exactly match the required schema for style_recommendation_a, leading to evaluation mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong tool (\"health_tips_b\" instead of \"health_tips_a\") and omitted the required \"age\" parameter, failing to follow the established pattern and the user’s contextual information from the prior exchange."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call lacked the detailed, context-rich problem description expected; it used a generic, minimal input instead of incorporating observations and troubleshooting steps already taken, leading to a mismatch with the required function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b as required, and did not update the evaluation_metrics to include only \"F1 score\" as requested. It failed to select the correct function and adapt to the user's metric request."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent made the correct function call to \"motivate_social_b\" with suitable arguments, but mismatched the \"relation\" value as \"coworker\" instead of the required \"co-worker\", leading to a parameter format error and failure to match the expected call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent supplied a parameter value (\"25 to 35\") with \"to\" instead of the required \"-\" (\"25-35\"), and gave extra detail for \"current_brand_status\" instead of exactly \"not well-known\", causing a schema mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name (\"med_aiArticleGen\") but emitted a non-standard tool_call output format instead of a valid function_call format, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call despite correct parameters."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"time_range\" key for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" array, whereas the expected function call only required listing the weekdays without specifying time ranges. This extra detail caused the function call to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"monumentDetails\" wrapper in its parameters and used sample IDs \"A\" and \"B\" instead of the full \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" labels, resulting in a parameter schema mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field in the privacy object of sessionDetails, resulting in an incorrect function call structure that did not match the expected tool input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call payload: it omitted the required wrapping \"articles\" key inside \"contentData\", placing the article list directly as \"contentData\", resulting in a schema mismatch the tool couldn't process."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's tool call response contained malformed JSON, missing a closing brace and bracket, resulting in a parsing failure. The logic and content of the arguments were correct, but improper JSON formatting caused the error."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contained malformed JSON due to a missing closing bracket, making it unparsable. This syntax error prevented the function call from executing, even though the logic and content of the action were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\") in its function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name but provided the \"themes\" argument at the wrong level—outside \"movieDetails\"—instead of nesting it under \"movieDetails\" as required by the function signature, resulting in no matching call detected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required empty \"settings\": {} field in the summary widget for the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the same-day cancellation penalty as 0.1 (interpreting 10% as the number 0.1) instead of the correct value 10, as specified in the input. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a separate function call for indirect employment, omitting half of the requested analysis despite the clear user prompt specifying both direct and indirect employment impacts."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unsupported \"winePreferences\" argument in its pairing_cheeseWineMatcher function calls, resulting in calls that did not exactly match the expected function signature, thus failing the evaluator's strict matching criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON due to an extraneous closing quotation mark after the array of response teams, causing a syntax error and preventing successful function invocation. Proper JSON formatting was not maintained in the tool call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a signature mismatch with the available \"content_moderation_analysis\" tool, and thus the evaluator did not recognize the call as valid."}

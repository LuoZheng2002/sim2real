Additionally, it included unnecessary fields (\"innovations\", \"audience_reaction\") in the fashion_week_trend_analyzer call and used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters\"."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required recent_activities field in the finance_credit_scoring function call, providing only financial_history. This led to a parameter mismatch and the function call not matching the expected input structure."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_3", "analysis": "The agent used a single-day timeframe (\"2025-10-09\" to \"2025-10-09\") for licensing queries instead of the full year (\"2025-01-01\" to \"2025-12-31\") as requested, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_7", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function names and parameters but failed to match the expected invocation due to a mismatch in the function registry—possibly by generating function calls before tool meta-data was loaded, missing the available \"artprint_meshScreenAnalyzer_1\" variant."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The agent included extraneous \"document_id\" fields in the insurance_claim_verification function call's \"documents\" array, deviating from the expected parameter schema, resulting in the evaluator failing to match the call despite otherwise correct tool usage and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"interactions\" field to the details object in its function calls, resulting in parameters that did not exactly match any available tool schema, thus failing to generate valid function calls as required."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"capacity\" field within the \"stadium\" parameter for the EventOrganizer_scheduleFootballMatch function, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameter schema, which only requires the stadium name. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent assigned an incorrect severity value (5 instead of 3) for the \"swelling\" symptom in the function call to ReptileBiteResponseSystem_evaluateBiteSeverity, causing a parameter mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent's VisaInformationManager_getVisaRequirements call omitted the required \"documentTypes\" parameter (e.g., \"passport\"), resulting in a function call that did not fully match the expected schema for the tool."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly batched all four vehicles into a single function call without generating individualized infrastructure responses per car. It failed to make separate function calls for each vehicle with specific parameters and appropriate context-based infrastructure actions."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_50", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"terms\" field in both RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation calls that was not present in the expected function schema, making its output not match the required function signature and causing the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra, unsupported \"terms\" parameters in the startNegotiation function call and omitted the required \"date\" parameter in the getMortgageDetails call, leading to function signature mismatches and failed tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in its tool call (missing closing braces), causing a parsing error and preventing execution.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_70", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"contact_number\" field in each applicant's details, which was not requested or expected. This led to a mismatch between the model's function calls and the expected parameters, causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly merged parameters for two distinct tasks into a single function call, rather than making separate calls to the news and audio processing tools as required.

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_84", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"settings\" parameter for HomeLightingControl_manageLightSettings as a list instead of an object, resulting in a mismatch with the expected argument structure and causing the function call to be unrecognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_85", "analysis": "The agent made function calls to CommunicationBlockadeManager_activateBlockade, but the available tool name likely required an exact string match or suffix (e.g., \"_1\"). The model did not disambiguate or select the correct tool name among multiple similarly named functions."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_87", "analysis": "The agent made correct function calls in terms of parameters, but failed to disambiguate between two similarly named tools and did not specify which \"olympics_get_top_athletes\" version to use, leading to a mismatch with available tool names."}

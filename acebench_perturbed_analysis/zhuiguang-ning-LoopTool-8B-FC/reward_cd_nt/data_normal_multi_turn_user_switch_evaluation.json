{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter (with \"keyLength\": 256) to the DataGuard_encryptBusinessData function call, which does not match the tool's accepted parameters and thus caused a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500 each month, resulting in a function call with mismatched parameters that did not align with the user's provided details."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"Paris, France\" for the location instead of just \"Paris\" as required by the function parameters, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to trigger the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function arguments and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent added unsupported \"translationFeatures\" parameters to the function call, deviating from the expected schema, which only allows the basic fields. This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId, included a non-existent \"digital map\" navigation option (\"mustSeeExhibits\" list), and unnecessarily populated \"mustSeeExhibits\" rather than leaving it empty per the user input and task requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The model included an unexpected, unsupported argument \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\" in the function call, causing it not to match the expected parameters and leading to evaluator rejection. The function call must strictly match the allowed signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in its TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected input and making the call invalid according to the tool's specification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent ignored the user's specified color preferences (primary: green, secondary: blue/#0000FF) and instead used unrelated color codes (#FF5733, #33D4FF) when invoking the logo_design_create function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The agent made the correct function call in terms of name and arguments, but failed to match the expected answer due to a capitalization mismatch in the \"details\" field (\"valuation summary\" vs \"Valuation summary\"), resulting in an exact-match evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"targetGroup\" parameter specifying \"finance department\" when calling HRMoodAnalyzer_createCustomSurvey, thus failing to tailor the survey to the correct audience as per the user’s original request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call to cultural_tour_experience, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"influence\" parameter in the function call to cultural_event_classical_music_impact, causing its output to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluator rejection. The function should only have included period, composer, and date_range."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra, unnecessary \"cities\": [] field in each location object, leading to a function call argument structure mismatch with the expected schema, causing no match to be recognized by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted weeks 2 and 3 from the training_schedule in its function call, providing only week 1's activities, thus failing to fully represent the user's specified 3-week training plan as required by the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call wrapped in XML-like tags (\"<tool_call>...</tool_call>\") instead of providing a raw, parseable JSON object, leading to a JSON parsing failure and tool invocation error."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent output valid JSON for the tool call but wrapped it in XML-like tags (\"<tool_call> ... </tool_call>\"), causing a JSON parsing failure. The agent failed to provide raw JSON as required by the function-calling interface."}

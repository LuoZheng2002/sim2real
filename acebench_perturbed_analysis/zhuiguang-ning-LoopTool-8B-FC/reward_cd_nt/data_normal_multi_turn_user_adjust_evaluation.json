{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required year in the start and end dates, providing \"March 8\" and \"March 22\" instead of the correctly formatted \"2024-03-08\" and \"2024-03-22\" as expected by the function."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_1 with no parameters, instead of PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback with the required employeeId and feedbackId. It failed to use the correct function and supply necessary arguments as specified in the tools and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent only created the 'Supervisor' role (with inheritance), but failed to include the previously defined 'Admin' and 'User' roles when calling securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles, omitting necessary roles expected in the function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent called the function to set up user roles instead of configuring access controls with specific permissions and audit settings as required; it failed to use the correct securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl function to assign the requested permissions to each role."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter in its function call to festival_art_schedule_creator, failing to include the alert configuration expected for schedule creation with reminders and alerts."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent included the extraneous word \"to\" at the start of the reviewReason field (\"to ensure compliance\") instead of matching the expected exact value (\"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a function call parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"near the Colosseum\" as the value for \"special_requests\" instead of assigning it to the \"location\" field as required by the function signature, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend\" instead of \"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_level\" instead of \"inventory_levels\"), causing its function call to not match the expected schema, which led to evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent generated a report using an incorrect innovation rate (65.0) for Team Alpha instead of the correct 70, failing to accurately use or propagate the team's original data as expected by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updated communicationModule settings, whereas the expected function call only updated the \"method\" field to \"Email\" without specifying \"frequency\". This mismatched structure prevented correct function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent called the function schedule_meeting instead of schedule_meeting_1, despite both being available. The evaluator expected use of schedule_meeting_1, indicating the agent failed to select the correct function variant as required by the test case."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name \"RuralRetreatOrganizer_bookAccommodation,\" but the function likely did not exactly match the tool’s expected signature due to an extra phrase in \"preferences\" (\"with breakfast included\" instead of \"with breakfast\") or minor schema deviation, resulting in no match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (with \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\" fields) in its function call to travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect insurance_cost value ($110 instead of the correct $120.5) and failed to match the insurance option explicitly stated in the prior context. This caused the budget calculation to use the wrong insurance price."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter in the travelDates object for the flight search, resulting in an incomplete function call that did not match the expected input for a round-trip flight."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"feedback_type\" parameter in the manage_feedback_collection function call, causing a mismatch with the available tool’s required parameters and resulting in no valid function call match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON due to an extra quotation mark after the number 9 in the traits array for both Alice and Bob, causing the function call to fail parsing. Proper JSON formatting was not maintained."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" instead of the required \"installments\" for the repayment option's optionType value, causing the function call to not match the expected schema. The function name was correct; the parameter value was not."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted required fields in the function call: it did not include \"existing_conditions\" for each traveler and did not provide the \"duration\" in coverage_options, both of which were expected by the function schema, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly modified the desired_qualities string from \"10 years of industry experience\" to \"at least 10 years of industry experience,\" causing the function call signature to not match the expected invocation and fail evaluator matching."}

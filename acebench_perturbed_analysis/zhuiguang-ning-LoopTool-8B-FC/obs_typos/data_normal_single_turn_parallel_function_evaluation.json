{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included document_id fields in the documents array for the insurance_claim_verification call, instead of only providing document_type as required, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"interactions\": false field in the \"details\" object for each function call, deviating from the expected function signature and causing no matching function calls to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assigned a severity value of 5 to the 'swelling' symptom instead of the expected value of 3, resulting in a function call parameter mismatch. All other parameters matched expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"themes\" parameter (\"Existentialism\") when calling PhilosophyCinemaExplorer_findPurposeDrivenFilms, and used the wrong analysis tool (CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzePhilosophicalThemes) instead of CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzeExistentialThemes for the detailed existential analysis of Blade Runner."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_81", "analysis": "The agent omitted required \"timeOfDay\" parameters in both function calls, resulting in incomplete arguments that do not match the expected schema for AudioConfigurator_optimizeSound and DiskTemperatureControl_adjustCoolingSystem. This caused the evaluator to reject the model's function calls."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_10_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to produce properly formatted JSON for the tool call by omitting the closing braces for both the \"arguments\" object and the overall JSON object, resulting in an invalid, unparsable output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"most recent\" instead of the required parameter value \"most-recent\" for feedbackId, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_11_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call had a typo in the word \"unforgetable\" instead of the required \"unforgettable\" in the description parameter, resulting in the function call not matching the expected parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_33_1", "analysis": "The agent misspelled the milestone name as \"Final Poject Review\" instead of the correct \"Final Project Review,\" causing its function call arguments not to match the expected output exactly.

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (enableAlerts and alertTime) in its festival_art_schedule_creator function call, failing to include event alerts and reminders as specified by the tool description and expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The root cause is a minor spelling error: \"reviewReason\" was set to \"to ensuer compliance\" instead of the expected \"ensure compliance\", leading to a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_0", "analysis": "The agent misspelled \"ravioli\" as \"raviolli\" in the function call arguments, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" field in the updated communicationModule settings, instead of only changing the \"method\" to \"Email\" as requested. This caused its function call not to match the expected one."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent outputted the correct function call in structure but failed to match the expected capitalization of the \"agenda\" value (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing an exact match failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the \"special_requests\" field instead of using it as the \"location,\" and used \"Rome\" as the location instead. This resulted in a function call argument mismatch, failing to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly averaged the innovation rates for Team Alpha and Team Beta instead of reporting each team's individual innovation rate as requested, thus providing a single value (65.0) for both teams rather than their actual separate rates (70 and 60)."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"insurance_cost\" parameter in the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget function call, even though insurance options and pricing had already been provided in the conversation context."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (including \"algorithm\" and \"forecasting\") in its function call, failing to fully utilize the tool designed for demand-driven, forecast-based deal aggregation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the preferences string instead of the expected \"breakfast\", resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to treat it as a non-match."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" (\"2024-01-03\") in the \"travelDates\" parameter for the function call, failing to match the user's specified round-trip travel dates and the benchmark's expected input."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter (\"overall_experience\") in its manage_feedback_collection function call, which was not expected or required by the tool specification, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" instead of the required \"installments\" for the optionType field, causing a mismatch with the expected function call schema and resulting in no match recognition by the evaluator."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent generated malformed JSON for the tool call due to an extra double quote after a numeric score, causing a parsing failure. This syntactic error prevented successful function invocation despite correct intent and parameter selection."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_14_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call returned malformed JSON; it omitted the final closing brace needed to complete the object. This caused a parsing error, preventing the tool function from executing with the provided project and phases data."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the \"desired_qualities\" value by adding the phrase \"at least\" (i.e., \"at least 10 years of industry experience\") instead of using the exact provided string (\"10 years of industry experience\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}

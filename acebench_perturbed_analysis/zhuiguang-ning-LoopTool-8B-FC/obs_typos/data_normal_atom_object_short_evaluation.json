{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"last_name\" field (\"Smith\") in the function call, providing only the first name, which resulted in the function call not matching the expected parameters despite receiving sufficient user information."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_4", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize the customer's question text, reproducing the user's typo (\"Wat time\") instead of correcting it to \"What time,\" as expected. This caused the function call parameters to mismatch and led to an unrecognized output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the function call, failing to match the required API signature, which resulted in no matching call being recognized by the evaluator. Only supported parameters should have been used."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in the function call arguments, which did not match the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to reject the call as non-matching despite otherwise correct parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary and overly detailed \"details\" field within the \"protocol\" object, resulting in invalid JSON and preventing successful parsing of the tool call as specified by the expected parameters schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used the lowercase \"pop\" for the genre parameter instead of the expected capitalized \"Pop,\" leading to a mismatch in the function call comparison and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"examples\" field under \"organismDetails\" that is not part of the expected function parameters, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"dataSources\" argument in its function call, deviating from the expected parameter schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a valid match."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"eventTypes\" parameter in the function call, which is not part of the expected or supported parameters for CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline, leading to a mismatch and failure to execute the intended function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_25", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contained an extra closing curly brace, resulting in invalid JSON that could not be parsed. This formatting error prevented proper function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included unsupported parameters (\"features\": [\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\"]) in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the tool's expected schema and therefore no valid function call was detected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") not present in the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch that caused the evaluator to not recognize the function calls as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" field in the \"correctionPreferences\" object for each function call, deviating from the expected parameters and resulting in a mismatch with the API schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent provided incorrect longitude precision for the Colosseum (-12.4923 instead of -12.4922) and incorrectly formatted the year \"100 AD\" as \"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\", leading to evaluation mismatch with expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_42", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize the date format in the \"hospitalization_period\" arguments, outputting dates as \"Janury 1, 2023\" instead of the required ISO format \"2023-01-01.\" This mismatch prevented the function calls from matching the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent included a trailing \"Z\" (indicating UTC) in the ISO timestamps, while the expected format omitted the \"Z\". This format mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_49", "analysis": "The agent misspelled the time zone as \"America/New_Yokr\" instead of \"America/New_York,\" causing the function call to not match the expected parameters and resulting in a failed test case."}

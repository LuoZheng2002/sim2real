{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_2", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"signature_options\" field in the function call arguments, which is not specified or accepted by the expected function schema, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the required function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included specific time ranges (\"08:00-17:00\") for each weekday in the \"time_restrictions\" field, rather than just specifying the days as required. The output format did not match the expected structure, causing the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sample IDs, returning \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" as required by the function specification, leading to a mismatch and failure in function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_11", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"amenities\" field in the FamilyGatheringVenueFinder function call, which does not match the tool's expected parameters. Only \"search_criteria\" is allowed; extra fields caused the function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field within the \"privacy\" object in its function call, failing to match the expected function signature and privacy settings structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"session_length\" parameter in the function call, which is not supported by the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the required function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"articles\" key when structuring the contentData parameter; it passed a list directly instead of nesting it under \"articles\" as expected by the function signature, resulting in a schema mismatch and failed tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to normalize participant cultural backgrounds from country names (\"Vietnam\", \"UK\", \"Spain\") to accepted demonyms/adjectives (\"Vietnamese\", \"British\", \"Spanish\") and did not capitalize the meeting topic as required by the function's expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information at the top level of the function call instead of nesting it under \"hikingDetails\" as required by the expected function signature, leading to a parameter structure mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent failed because it produced an incomplete JSON object (missing a closing bracket), resulting in a JSON parsing error and preventing the function call from being processed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent outputted the tool call inside a non-standard <tool_call> XML tag instead of the required plain JSON format, causing a parsing failure. The function arguments themselves were otherwise correct, but the response format was invalid."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The model included an extraneous period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing a parameter mismatch with the expected function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\": {} object in the widget configuration for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent outputted invalid JSON due to missing closing braces in each function call, and also incorrectly set the penalty as 0.1 instead of 10 for same-day cancellations for R123 and R456, failing to match the expected policy details."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment and failed to make a second function call for indirect employment, thus not covering both employment types as explicitly requested in the user query."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unused \"winePreferences\" field in the function call arguments instead of strictly following the expected parameter structure, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON by omitting a closing brace at the end of the arguments object, resulting in a JSON parsing error and preventing successful invocation of the intended tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent generated malformed JSON for the function call by adding an extraneous double quote after the closing brace of the \"responseTeams\" array, resulting in a syntax error that prevented the tool call from being parsed and executed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added the extra parameter \"analysis_depth\" to the content_moderation_analysis function call, which was not expected or required by the tool schema, leading to a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose baby_health_check_A instead of baby_health_check_B, failing to use the appropriate function for examining persistent vein visibility with associated symptoms as required for this scenario."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as \"18 to 25 degrees Celsius\" instead of the expected \"18 to 25\", including unnecessary units. This led to a mismatch with the required function argument format and caused evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_5", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect input string (\"Thsi\" instead of \"This\"), failing to match the expected function call's parameters exactly, resulting in a mismatch and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the phrase_interpret_b tool instead of the required phrase_interpret_a tool, failing to match the expected function call for interpreting the given phrase."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent reused user language verbatim instead of synthesizing a structured, domain-specific analysis for 'competitor_analysis', generalized or omitted required evaluation criteria details, and made errors in customer demographic values, resulting in an invalid function call argument structure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The model incorrectly altered the parameter name \"conflict_element\" value from \"AI control\" (expected) to \"conflict over AI control\" (actual), causing a mismatch with the function signature and resulting in evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included all previous tasks along with the new one in the function call instead of adding only the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task as required, and also failed to map the \"Urgent\" priority to the expected \"High\" priority for that task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The root cause is that the model's function call arguments used paraphrased or shortened values (\"technology and renewable energy sectors\", \"substantial amount saved, owning property, and minimal debt\"), and a mismatched goal description, which did not exactly match the expected parameters, resulting in a strict mismatch for the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_26", "analysis": "The agent misspelled the \"writing_level\" parameter as \"intermedaite\" instead of \"intermediate\", causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but failed to include the expanded, context-rich problem description reflecting prior troubleshooting steps and the explicit request for diverse perspectives, resulting in insufficient parameters for clarity_guide_b."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of the required analyze_social_data_b function, failing to use the expected tool needed for analyzing buying tendencies as specified in the task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_40", "analysis": "The agent passed the poem text with a typo (\"noets\" instead of \"notes\") instead of correcting it as in the expected answer, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The model generated function arguments that did not precisely match the expected schema: it used \"coworker\" instead of \"co-worker,\" omitted the \"often\" qualifier in the status, and paraphrased rather than copying the details as specified, causing the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The function call failed to match due to formatting discrepancies: the model used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\" for age_group and \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" instead of the expected \"not well-known\" for current_brand_status, causing the strict match to fail."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The model outputted the function call correctly, but used title-case (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") instead of lower-case (\"AI applications in oncology\") for the title argument, causing a strict evaluator mismatch."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly mapped the relationships for the beneficiaries: it labeled \"User\" as \"Grandson\" and \"Sister\" as \"Daughter,\" instead of identifying both as \"grandchild\" per the expected parameters. This mismatch led to the function call schema not matching expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The root cause is that the model formatted the \"start\" and \"end\" dates in the time_frame argument with full timestamps (including \"T00:00:00Z\"), whereas the expected format requires only the date string (YYYY-MM-DD), causing a mismatch in function call arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to match the expected function call parameters: it used an incorrect \"sourceId\" (\"techdataapi\" instead of \"1\") and omitted the required \"accessProtocol\" (\"HTTPS\") in the \"details\" field, leading to a mismatch with the tool's expected input format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the time values by including a 'Z' (indicating Zulu/UTC timezone) at the end of the ISO timestamps, which did not match the expected format without the 'Z', leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent added an extra parameter, \"includeHistoricalData\": false, and used timestamps with a \"Z\" suffix and different end time format, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and preventing output matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls instead of combining both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption tasks into a single call to WebSecurity_EncryptionManager, as required by the tool's multi-parameter capability."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent used \"Adventure in Hawaii\" as the campaign title instead of \"Adventure and Travel in Hawaii\" as required. This title mismatch caused the function call not to match exactly, leading to the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a casing mismatch in device names (\"Smartphone\", \"Laptop\" instead of the expected lowercase \"smartphone\", \"laptop\"), resulting in no exact function call match per the evaluator's strict comparison rules."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in its function call to AccountManager_verifyDocument, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the output."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter and slightly altered the feature description (\"distinctive long beak\" instead of \"long beak\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data parameter, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema. This structural error caused the evaluator to reject the function call despite otherwise correct content."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_38", "analysis": "The agent misspelled the restaurant_id as \"Luigi's Italian Restaruant\" instead of the correct \"Luigi's Italian Restaurant,\" causing the function call not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The root cause is a mismatch in the parameter name: the agent used \"imageData\" (correct), but the value was a placeholder (\"base64 encoded string of the image\") instead of the required actual provided string. This did not match the evaluator's expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete due to a missing closing brace, resulting in invalid and unparsable output. Additionally, the agent used \"our latest product video\" instead of the required \"latest product video\" for the digital display content."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent returned the child's preferences in a different order (\"Reading\", \"Puzzles\") than the expected output (\"Puzzles\", \"Reading\"), causing an exact match failure even though the content was otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_54", "analysis": "The agent passed \"Jvaa\" (a misspelling) instead of \"Java\" as a current skill to the function, failing to perform entity normalization or spell correction before function call construction."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"pure green tea leaves\" as the ingredient instead of the expected \"green tea leaves,\" causing a mismatch with the required function call parameters and leading to failure in matching the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unnecessary \"readingLevel\" field in the userProfile argument, causing the function call to not match the expected parameters and resulting in evaluator failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent misspelled \"kitchen\" as \"kitcehn,\" omitted the installation date for sensor 001, and failed to include all required parameters exactly as specified, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_73", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included Saturday and Sunday in the schedule instead of restricting the setup to only weekdays (Monday to Friday) as specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The failure was due to using floating-point values (0.0, 5.0) for costAdjustment instead of integers (0, 5) as expected, causing a mismatch and preventing the function call from matching the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_75", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"perennials\" preference to false instead of true, misunderstanding \"don't mind them being perennials\" as a negative preference rather than accepting perennials. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the numeric values for \"min\" and \"max\" budget as floating-point numbers (1000.0, 2000.0) instead of integers (1000, 2000), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent failed due to misspelling \"Chicago\" as \"Chciago\" in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the call as correct."}

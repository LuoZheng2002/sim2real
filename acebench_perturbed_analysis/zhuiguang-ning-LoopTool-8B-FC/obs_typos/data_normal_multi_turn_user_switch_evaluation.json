{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter (\"keyLength\": 256) in the function call, causing the call not to match the expected schema, which only accepts \"data,\" \"encryptionMethod,\" and \"logActivity\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500 per month, resulting in an argument mismatch for the FinanceManager_createBudgetPlan function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in its function call to ImmigrationPlanner_findTemporaryResidencyOptions, leading to a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the model's output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was malformed due to a missing closing brace, resulting in a parsing error. Additionally, it propagated the user's typo (\"Deadlien\" instead of \"Deadline\") instead of correcting it in the template fields."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"marketSegment\" parameter (\"smartphones\") when calling CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a function call mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra parameter \"analysisDepth\": \"shallow\" in its function call, which was not expected. This caused a mismatch with the required function signature, resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the model's function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent selected an incorrect value for the primary color, using \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of the requested \"#00FF00\" (bright green) as specified by the user, resulting in mismatch with expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter and included \"mustSeeExhibits\" not specified by the user, leading to a function call mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in its TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus a failure to fulfill the tool's input specifications."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in its function call to cultural_tour_experience, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to book the tour as specified."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The failure occurred because the model's tool call argument key was named \"arguments\" instead of the expected \"parameters,\" causing the evaluator to not recognize or match the function call despite otherwise correct content."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"influence\" parameter (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in the function call, which is not part of the expected function signature, causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_0", "analysis": "The agent added extra, unsupported parameters (\"session_time\" and \"interactive_elements\") to the vr_experience_create_virtual_tour function call instead of matching the expected parameter schema, leading to the function call mismatch and failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an \"estimated_time\" field for each task in the function call, which is not part of the expected parameters for goal_set_priority_tasks, causing a mismatch with the required function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent included city-level information (\"Berlin\", \"Munich\", \"Paris\", \"Marseille\") in the 'locations' parameter, but the function expects only country-level inputs (\"Germany\" and \"France\"), causing a parameter schema mismatch and function call failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_40_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"blue\" as the colorScheme value instead of the required hex color code \"#0000FF\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to correctly call the WorkflowMonitor_createDashboard function as specified in the schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent produced a function call using an invalid JSON format—likely due to extraneous whitespace, improper escaping, or incorrect structure—causing the parser to fail. The root cause is outputting malformed JSON rather than a structurally valid function call payload."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The root cause of the failure was malformed JSON in the tool call, likely due to an extra or missing character, preventing parsing. Additionally, there is a typo in the program name (\"Gold Benfits Club\" instead of \"Gold Benefits Club\")."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent included an extra 4th week in the training_schedule argument when only 3 weeks were specified by the user, causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}

All other function arguments were correct."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_4", "analysis": "The agent output multiple tool calls concatenated together within a single <tool_call> block, resulting in invalid JSON formatting that could not be parsed. Each tool call should be separate and properly formatted to comply with the expected structure."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided extra document_id fields for the documents in the insurance_claim_verification function call, exceeding the expected parameters, which led to a mismatch with the evaluator's strict parameter schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_35", "analysis": "The agent unnecessarily included an extra \"interactions\": false key in the details object of each function call, causing a parameter mismatch and preventing recognition of the calls as valid by the evaluator. The expected schema required only \"settlements\" and \"routes\"."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly assigned a severity of 5 to the \"swelling\" symptom instead of the expected severity of 3, resulting in a function call argument mismatch that prevented the correct identification of the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_38", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"themes\": [\"Existentialism\"] parameter in the PhilosophyCinemaExplorer_findPurposeDrivenFilms call and incorrectly used CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzePhilosophicalThemes instead of CinemaPhilosophyAnalyzer_analyzeExistentialThemes for the detailed existential analysis of Blade Runner."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"advisoryDetails\" and omitted \"documentTypes\": [\"passport\"]) to the function calls, resulting in parameter mismatches with the expected schema and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_42", "analysis": "The agent's function calls were missing the required \"event_details\" parameter; it failed to include this empty list in its arguments, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call format."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"terms\" (deposit and closing costs) in the RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation function calls, which were not part of the expected parameters, causing the function signature to not match and resulting in a failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_51", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"terms\" parameter in the RealEstateBiddingAssistant_startNegotiation function call, and omitted the required \"date\" parameter in RealEstateAdvisor_getMortgageDetails, resulting in function calls that do not match the expected tool schemas."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_53", "analysis": "The agent failed to distinguish between the two resistors in the second circuit, labeling both connections generically as \"resistor\" instead of using unique identifiers (e.g., \"resistor1\" and \"resistor2\"), resulting in incorrect connection specification."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_55", "analysis": "The agent made a correct football_venue_management function call, but failed the benchmark due to a mismatch in argument formatting—specifically, the description field capitalization (\"turf maintenance\" instead of \"Turf maintenance\")—causing the evaluator to not recognize it as a matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_70", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"contact_number\" field with empty values in the applicant_details for each license application instead of matching the expected parameters, which require only \"name\" and \"address.\" This caused the function call signature mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_76", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"reverb\" effect's \"intensity\" parameter to 0.9 instead of the required 1, and included unnecessary parameters (\"apply_time\": \"real-time\") not specified or expected, causing the function call to not match the expected schema."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_parallel_function_84", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly wrapped the \"settings\" parameter for HomeLightingControl_manageLightSettings inside a list, instead of providing it as an object as required. This structural mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}

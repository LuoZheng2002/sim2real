{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") not supported or required by the SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery function, leading to a function call mismatch and evaluator rejection. Only the specified timePeriod and region parameters should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in its function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema. This extraneous parameter caused the call to not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"schedule\" parameter specifying daily execution at 6:00 AM in its function call, omitting the scheduling aspect requested by the user."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"genre\": \"pop\" with a lowercase \"p\" instead of the expected \"Pop\" (uppercase \"P\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_19", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"examples\" field within the \"organismDetails\" object, causing its function call to deviate from the expected schema and resulting in a mismatch with the available tool's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"dataSources\" argument (\"satellite\") in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters and failure to match the defined function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"eventTypes\" parameter in the CaseTimelineGenerator_generateTimeline function call, which does not match the required parameters and caused the function call to be rejected. Only caseId and timeRange were expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added unsupported features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") to the \"features\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary and unsupported parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") to the function calls instead of only including the required \"date_range\", resulting in the tool call arguments not matching the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added a \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" parameter to \"correctionPreferences\", which was not present in the expected function signature. This caused the function calls to not match the expected schema, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values and formatted the year for the Colosseum date incorrectly (missing leading zero), resulting in function call arguments that did not exactly match the expected ones, leading to call mismatch during evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent formatted the time fields with a 'Z' suffix (indicating UTC) in the ISO string, while the expected output required the time fields to be formatted without the 'Z'. This mismatch caused failure to match the function calls."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for related actions that should have been combined into a single call to the WebSecurity_EncryptionManager tool with both sslTlsManagement and dataAtRestEncryption parameters included."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent misidentified the relationships of the beneficiaries, labeling them as \"Grandson\" and \"Daughter\" instead of the correct relationship \"grandchild\" for both. This caused the function call parameters to not match the expected schema, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"time_frame\" values using full ISO datetime strings with times and \"Z\" (UTC), instead of the required date-only \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as a match."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent generated the correct function and parameters, but used \"sourceId\": \"techdataapi\" instead of the required \"sourceId\": \"1\", causing the function call not to match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent outputted the function call with timestamps including trailing \"Z\" (UTC designator), differing from the expected format without \"Z\". This mismatch prevented the evaluator from matching the function call, resulting in failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"includeHistoricalData\" parameter and used timestamps with timezone information (\"Z\") for timeRange, while the expected call omitted \"includeHistoricalData\" and used timestamps without \"Z\" and with different end time granularity, leading to a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent altered the campaign title from \"Adventure and Travel in Hawaii\" (as required) to \"Hawaii Adventure Campaign,\" failing to exactly preserve the specified title, which led to a mismatch in the expected and actual function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The model capitalized the device_name fields (\"Smartphone\" and \"Laptop\") instead of using lowercase (\"smartphone\" and \"laptop\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter and incorrectly specified the feature as \"distinctive long beak\" instead of the expected \"long beak,\" leading to a mismatch with the function signature and the benchmark comparator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"historical\": false field in the traffic_data and did not include \"San Francisco\" in the store_details location, resulting in a function call that didn't match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent called ContentAuthenticity_verifyImageOriginality, but the function call argument key was \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters,\" resulting in a structural mismatch with the expected schema and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was malformed and missing a closing brace, leading to a parsing error and failed execution. Additionally, the \"content\" field did not exactly match the expected string (\"our latest product video\" vs. \"latest product video\")."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly expanded the child's preferences to include \"Drawing\" and \"Music\" instead of limiting them to the specified \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as stated in the user's request, leading to a parameter mismatch and function call rejection."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent specified \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" for the ingredients list, resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the evaluator to reject the function call as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unnecessary and unsupported \"readingLevel\" field in the \"userProfile\" parameter, causing the function call signature to not match the expected schema for BookRecommendationEngine_fetchRecommendations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_67", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"installationDate\" for the kitchen sensor in its function call, failing to include all required parameters as specified in the user's request. This mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected structure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent used floating-point numbers (0.0, 5.0) for costAdjustment instead of the expected integers (0, 5), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_75", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"perennials\" to false in the preferences, contradicting the user's statement of not minding perennials. This caused a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the budget values as floating-point numbers (1000.0, 2000.0) instead of integers (1000, 2000), resulting in a strict function call mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent included time values in the timeWindow with seconds and a \"Z\" timezone designator (e.g., \"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\"), whereas the expected format omitted seconds and timezone (\"2020-03-01T00:00:00\"). This mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"time_frame\" parameter not supported by the function signature, causing a mismatch with the expected function call. It should have only included \"material_type\" and \"details\" parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_89", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an \"archives\" parameter and unnecessary nested structure not supported by the tool's schema, resulting in a function call format that did not match the expected input.

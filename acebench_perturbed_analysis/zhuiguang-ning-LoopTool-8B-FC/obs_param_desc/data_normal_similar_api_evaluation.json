{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to select the function that specifically addresses vein visibility with associated symptoms and duration, as described in the tool definitions and exemplified in the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent formatted the \"temperature_range\" parameter as a string (\"18 to 25 degrees Celsius\") instead of matching the expected format (\"18 to 25\"), causing a mismatch with the function signature required by the benchmark."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called the function phrase_interpret_b instead of the required phrase_interpret_a, failing to match the expected tool for interpreting the phrase according to the given instructions and previous context."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to accurately extract and structure the provided competitor analysis, customer demographics, and evaluation criteria, instead paraphrasing or inventing information rather than mapping user data to the expected function parameter schema required by strategy_selector_a."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified the conflict_element parameter as \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected \"AI control\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included all previous tasks along with the new task in the function call instead of scheduling only the newly added \"Prepare Presentation\" task as requested, and also failed to harmonize the priority label to \"High\" as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called finance_advisor_b instead of the required finance_advisor_a function, failing to use the correct tool specified for the task despite similar descriptions for both advisors."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the age_range to \"20-25\" instead of matching the user's age (26) to the correct \"25-30\" range, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a, and omitted the required \"age\" parameter, failing to match the function and arguments specified in the previous system demonstration and user context."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent's function call used an overly brief problem description rather than the detailed, context-rich description expected, lacking specifics such as attempted troubleshooting steps and the explicit request for diverse perspectives. This caused an argument mismatch with the evaluator's expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function call by passing the 'target' values as a separate array, instead of integrating each target value with its corresponding dataset entry as required. This resulted in a parameter format mismatch for model_optimizer_y."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The model used string values for preprocessing rules (\"clean data\", \"deduplicate\", \"normalize text data\") instead of the required parameter keys (\"clean_data\", \"deduplicate\", \"normalize_text\"), causing the function call not to match the tool's expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" in the relationship description, causing a schema mismatch that led to the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent's function arguments did not exactly match the expected parameters: it passed \"25 to 35\" (not \"25-35\") and \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\" (not just \"not well-known\"). This mismatch prevented correct function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The function call failed to match because the \"title\" parameter's capitalization (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") did not exactly match the expected string (\"AI applications in oncology\"), leading to a strict comparison failure in the evaluator."}

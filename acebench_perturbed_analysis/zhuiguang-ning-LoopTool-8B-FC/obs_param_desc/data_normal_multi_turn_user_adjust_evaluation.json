{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide dates in the required \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, instead using \"March 8\" and \"March 22\", which led to the function call not matching the expected parameters for execution."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_12_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"previous month\" as the timeFrame argument instead of the required \"last month,\" resulting in a mismatch between its function call and the expected parameters. The function call argument did not exactly match the acceptable values."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_10_0", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON by omitting the closing brackets for the \"arguments\" object and the Tool Call. This syntactic error prevented successful function invocation, even though the overall structure and parameters were otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The model used \"most recent\" instead of the expected \"most-recent\" for the feedbackId parameter, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call signature and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required 'User' role in the function call to securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles, including only 'Admin' and 'Supervisor', despite prior context specifying that 'User' should also be set up."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_34_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the date_range parameter as \"2025-05-14/2025-05-16\" using a slash, while the expected format was \"2025-05-14 to 2025-05-16\" with \" to \" separating the dates. This mismatch caused the function call to be unrecognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter (with enableAlerts and alertTime) in its function call, failing to match the expected input schema for festival_art_schedule_creator and thus not fulfilling the scheduling and alert request completely."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added \"to\" in the reviewReason parameter (\"to ensure compliance\" instead of \"ensure compliance\"), resulting in a function call argument mismatch with the expected parameters. This minor text deviation caused the function call to be marked as non-matching."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the unchanged \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" in the updatedToolSettings for communicationModule, whereas only the explicitly modified setting \"method\": \"Email\" should have been provided according to the expected function call structure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the special_requests field instead of the location field for the book_dining function, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the tool's interface and causing the function call to not be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent formatted the schedule_meeting function call correctly in both structure and content, but failed to match the required capitalization of the agenda parameter (\"finalize and sign the contract\" instead of \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), leading to a mismatch with the evaluator's expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used an averaged innovation rate (65% for Team Alpha), rather than each team's individual rate (Team Alpha: 70%, Team Beta: 60%), resulting in an inaccurate function call to GenerateTeamSummary_reportSuccessMetrics."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent called the travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget function but omitted the required insurance_cost parameter, even though insurance cost options were provided earlier. As a result, the function call was incomplete and did not match expectations."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter with demand-driven algorithm and forecasting, resulting in an incomplete function call that does not utilize the tool's key dynamic pricing features as expected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent included \"breakfast included\" in the \"preferences\" parameter instead of the expected \"breakfast\"; this mismatch caused the function call not to match the expected parameters, leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent's function call to travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter (\"2024-01-03\") in the travelDates object, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to find matching deals for the requested round-trip flight."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter and a \"form_title\" field in the function call, which are not part of the expected schema, causing the function signature to mismatch and resulting in evaluator failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to filter out the non-transformational (transactional) leader team from the input before calling the function, resulting in an incorrect function call that included invalid data not meeting the tool's specified input requirements."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"duration\" field within the \"coverage_options\" parameter when calling travel_budget_manager_get_insurance_options, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}

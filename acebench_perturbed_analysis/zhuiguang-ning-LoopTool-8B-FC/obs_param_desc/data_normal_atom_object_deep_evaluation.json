{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"time_range\" values for each weekday within \"time_restrictions\", whereas the expected function call only required listing the days without any time ranges. This schema mismatch caused the evaluator to reject the tool call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix from the sampleIDs in its function call, using \"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" as specified in the user input, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field inside the \"privacy\" object when calling ConferenceSessionManager_createSession, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the function arguments by placing \"articles\" and \"userPreferences\" directly inside the \"contentData\" list, instead of nesting them under a single \"articles\" array within an object, as required by the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to map the participants' \"culture\" values to their full cultural backgrounds (\"Vietnam\" instead of \"Vietnamese\", etc.), resulting in argument mismatches that prevented an exact function call match with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information outside the \"hikingDetails\" object in its function call. The API expects \"gear\" nested within \"hikingDetails,\" leading to a structural mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_26", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output had malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace, causing parsing to fail. This indicates the agent didn't correctly complete or validate the JSON structure before emitting the tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent output valid JSON but wrapped it in an XML-like <tool_call> tag, causing the JSON parser to fail. The root cause is incorrect output formatting, not a reasoning or parameter-selection issue."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra \"capacity\" parameter not expected by the function signature, causing the function call to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget in the dark-themed dashboard, resulting in a function call argument that didn't exactly match the expected schema and thus failed strict evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent output invalid JSON—missing closing braces—causing a parsing failure. Additionally, it used a penalty value of 0.1 instead of 10 for allowed same-day cancellations, misrepresenting the required penalty format in the function arguments."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment impact, omitting the required separate analysis for indirect employment. It should have made two function calls—one for direct and one for indirect employment—with otherwise identical parameters except for the employment type."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included a \"winePreferences\" argument in its function calls, which is not part of the expected parameters schema; only the \"cheese\" object with its name and characteristics should have been provided."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for its function call by omitting the closing brackets for both the \"arguments\" object and the overall JSON object, resulting in an unparsable tool call rather than a valid, executable request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for the tool call by including an extra double quote after the closing curly brace of the responseTeams array, resulting in a syntax error and failed function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter to the content_moderation_analysis function call, causing a mismatch with the tool's expected parameters and resulting in evaluator rejection. The function call should have included only \"content\" and \"context\"."}

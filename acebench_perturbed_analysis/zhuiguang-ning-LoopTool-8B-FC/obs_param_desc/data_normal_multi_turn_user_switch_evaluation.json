{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_12_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"additionalOptions\" parameter (with \"keyLength\": 256) in the function call arguments, causing the call to not match the required function signature.

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_8_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"Utilities\" expense amount to 50 instead of the requested 500, resulting in a function call with wrong parameter values for \"expenseCategories\". This caused a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\": \"Immediate\" parameter in the function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call schema and failure to call the tool correctly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_16_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"analysisPeriod\" parameter (\"2023-12\") in its SuggestionAnalyzer_refineSuggestions function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluation to fail."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_21_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"location\" parameter as \"Paris, France\" instead of the expected \"Paris,\" causing a mismatch and failure to match the evaluator's required function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent included extra, unsupported parameters (translationFeatures) in its function call to CulturalTranslator_translateInteraction instead of strictly following the expected parameter schema (only sourceLanguage, targetLanguage, content, and contentType). This caused a mismatch and the call was not recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in its function call to CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call format. This missing field caused the benchmark to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect value \"Louvre\" instead of the required \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter and included non-empty mustSeeExhibits, which should have been an empty list per the expected call. These parameter mismatches caused the function call not to be recognized."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an extra parameter \"analysisDepth\": \"deep\" in the function call, which is not part of the expected function signature, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and function call format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature.

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_42_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"#008000\" (a darker green) instead of \"#00FF00\" (the expected bright green) as the primary color, failing to accurately fulfill the user's explicit preference for green as specified in the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The model's function call argument keys did not correctly match the expected \"parameters\" structure required by the tool API; it used \"arguments\" instead of \"parameters,\" causing evaluator mismatch and failure to recognize the correct function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_39_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"targetGroup\": \"finance department\" parameter in the HRMoodAnalyzer_createCustomSurvey function call, omitting a key detail about whom the survey is intended for, despite this being specified in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call to cultural_tour_experience, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters and failure to trigger the correct tool invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent included an extra \"influence\" field (\"opera\", \"symphony\") in its function call arguments, which is not supported by the expected function schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_38_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"estimated_time\" field in each task when calling goal_set_priority_tasks, instead of only providing \"task_name\" and \"priority\" as required by the tool's specification. This caused the function call to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_0", "analysis": "The agent added extra, unsupported parameters (\"session_time\" and \"interactive_elements\") to the function call instead of strictly adhering to the required arguments (\"destination\" and \"vr_platform\"), causing the function call not to match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unnecessary city-level detail (\"cities\": [...]) in the locations parameter. The function expects only country-level information, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent included raw XML-like tags (<tool_call> ... </tool_call>) around its JSON tool call output, causing JSON parsing to fail. The tool call should have been provided as pure JSON without any extra markup."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_43_0", "analysis": "The agent produced valid JSON content for the tool call, but incorrectly wrapped it in XML-like <tool_call> tags, causing a parsing error. The failure is due to improper output formatting, not an issue with argument structure or tool choice."}

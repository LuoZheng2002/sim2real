{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent called the addToCart function with \"UserPreferredCategories\" as \"Sports\" instead of the required \"Sports Goods,\" resulting in no exact match with the expected function call parameters. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an extra, unsupported parameter (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") to the loginUser function call and used the wrong password, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and arguments."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed to preserve the required phrase \"a town near Austin, TX\" for the UserHomeLocation parameter, instead paraphrasing it as \"Town near Austin, TX,\" causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books\" instead of \"Wellness,\" failing to infer or use the correct user preference category for a yoga mat, which caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Standard\" for UserMemberStatus instead of \"Bronze\" as indicated in the expected output, failing to leverage the user's membership benefits in the shipping cost calculation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserSpendingLimit\" to 100 instead of the user's actual usual spending limit of 350, leading to a mismatch with the expected parameters for the processPayment call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent only provided the new home location in its updateUserProfile call, omitting other required fields (name, email, language, timezone, birthday), resulting in an incomplete function call that doesn't match the expected schema for updating the user profile."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent used \"Platinum\" for UserMemberStatus instead of the required \"Gold\" status, indicating it either hallucinated or incorrectly inferred the membership tier, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly sent an order update with the status \"Pending\" instead of the expected \"Out for Delivery,\" failing to retrieve or infer the current actual order status before sending the update."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included both \"Gluten-Free\" and \"Shellfish-Free\" as dietary preferences in the updateMenuItem call, instead of only \"Gluten-Free\" as expected, leading to a parameter mismatch with the benchmark's required function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected tool signature and failure to process the payment as specified."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly changed the user's password from \"Jessie90#\" to \"Jessie90#new\" instead of retaining the provided password, resulting in a mismatched function call with an incorrect parameter value."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call. This missing parameter led to the failure, as the function call did not match the expected signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Indian\" instead of \"Indian restaurant\" for the RestaurantName, and duplicated dietary preferences by including both \"Vegetarian\" and \"Gluten-Free\" instead of only the requested \"Gluten-Free,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch for function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model incorrectly capitalized the \"OrderName\" parameter (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and improperly included \"UserDietaryPreference\" as a parameter, rather than leaving it null as required by the function's specification."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the required \"sushi order\" for the OrderName parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call and resulting in failure to match the test case criteria."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly inferred or hallucinated that the user's dietary preferences are \"Keto\" instead of correctly defaulting to [\"None\"] as expected; there was no mention or evidence of specific preferences in the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the RestaurantName and set \"Vegan\" for UserDietaryPreference instead of \"Spicy,\" leading to a failure to match the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required Amount parameter in the processRefund call and used the incorrect UserRefundPreference (\"Original Method\" instead of \"Store Credit\"), failing to provide all necessary details for successful function execution."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent outputted \"Low sodium\" (lowercase \"s\") instead of the expected \"Low Sodium\" (capitalized) for the UserDietaryPreference parameter, causing a mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly updated the user's home location to \"New York, NY\" instead of the correct \"San Diego, CA\" as required by the expected parameters, resulting in a mismatch and failure to match the function call."}

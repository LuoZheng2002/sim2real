{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported parameter (\"analysisDepth\": 5) in the function call to ShootingTechniqueEvaluator, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and failure to match the evaluator's criteria."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"visualizationType\": \"3D model\" parameter in its GalaxyVisualizationGenerator function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. The call lacked a mandated argument."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"minRating\": 4 parameter in its LocalFoodDeliverySearch call, failing to restrict results to highly rated options as implied by the user's request."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent ignored the provided values for service sector growth (5.6) and foreign investment (900), defaulting to 0 and omitting required parameters, resulting in incorrect function arguments that did not match user intent or the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_33", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"characterName\" parameter in the GetCharacterBackground function call, providing only \"animeId\" and \"includeSpoilers.\" This caused a mismatch with the expected function signature and a complete failure to retrieve character-specific background information."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent used an unrealistically low value (10) for the \"receptionDelay\" parameter instead of the expected 1200, likely misinterpreting or ignoring the context that should determine the delay causing the message reception issue."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback_Budget instead of the correct, lower-cost PerformanceFeedbackManager_analyzeFeedback function, failing to match the expected function call with the required parameters for employee ID and feedback ID."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required 'Admin' and 'User' roles when calling securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles, only specifying the new 'Supervisor' role. It should have listed all three roles to properly set up the hierarchy."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" field (with alert settings) in its festival_art_schedule_creator function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function signature."}

This mismatch caused the function call to be rejected."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed \"near the Colosseum\" in the \"special_requests\" field instead of the \"location\" parameter for the book_dining function, resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the function call not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_23_0", "analysis": "The agent used incorrect widget_id values (\"sales_trend\" and \"inventory_level\") instead of the expected (\"sales_trends\" and \"inventory_levels\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and resulting in the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The agent formatted the function call correctly but omitted capitalizing the first letter of the agenda string (\"finalize\" instead of \"Finalize\"), resulting in a parameter value mismatch with the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent outputted a hardcoded or averaged innovation rate (65% for Team Alpha) instead of correctly reflecting the team-specific data (70% for Team Alpha). It failed to use the provided inputs for generating accurate, individualized team summaries."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (travelDealsAggregator_fetchDeals) but failed to include the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter (\"algorithm\": \"demand-driven\", \"forecasting\": true), resulting in an incomplete and unmatched function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call included \"preferences\": \"cozy cottage with breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"cozy cottage with breakfast\", causing a mismatch due to the extra word \"included\" which led to failure in matching the function call parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect insurance cost ($110 instead of $120.5) when calling the travel budget calculator, failing to select the price for the insurance option that matched all requested coverages, as previously provided in the insurance options list."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" parameter (\"2024-01-03\") in the travelDates for the flight deals function call, providing only the departure date, and thus did not fully match the user's specified round-trip travel dates."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent made an unnecessary call to securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles before configuring access control, while the task only required configuring access control. This resulted in an extra, irrelevant function call, causing the mismatch with the expected answer."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"feedback_type\" parameter to the manage_feedback_collection function call, which is not part of the function's expected signature, causing a schema mismatch and resulting in no match being found by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"existing_conditions\" field in the traveler_details array and did not include the \"duration\" field in coverage_options, resulting in a function call that did not fully match the expected parameters, causing evaluation failure."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_37_0", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON in its tool call by including an extra closing quotation mark after the number in the last \"score\" field of each leader's traits, making the output unparsable and preventing correct function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent altered the criteria \"10 years of industry experience\" to \"at least 10 years of industry experience\" in the function call, creating a string mismatch that prevented recognition as a correct call despite using the correct tool and parameters otherwise."}

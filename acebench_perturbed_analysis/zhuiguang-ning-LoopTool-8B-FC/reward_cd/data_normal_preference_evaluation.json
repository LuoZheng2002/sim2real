{"id": "normal_preference_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required security question and answer parameters in the resetPassword function call, omitting key information explicitly requested in the user prompt and necessary for successful password reset according to the expected specification."}
{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sports\" instead of \"Sports Goods\" for the UserPreferredCategories parameter, leading to a function call mismatch against the expected parameters. All other arguments match, but this key detail caused the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user’s preferred login time and login frequency parameters in the loginUser call, failing to provide all required contextual details specified in the instructions. Additionally, it used the wrong password value."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and appropriate arguments but did not match the expected parameter value \"a town near Austin, TX\" for UserHomeLocation, instead omitting the \"a,\" causing the evaluator to treat it as a mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"UserPreferredCategories\" to \"Books\" instead of \"Wellness\" as expected, likely failing to infer or retrieve the user's true category preference relevant to a yoga mat in this context."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent supplied the correct function and nearly correct arguments but failed to use the required UserMemberStatus (\"Bronze\") from context, instead incorrectly used \"Platinum,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect value for UserSpendingLimit ($100 instead of the correct $350 from user preferences), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters. This caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent used \"San Diego, CA\" instead of the required \"San Diego, California\" for the UserHomeLocation argument, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter in its function call to calculateShippingCost, resulting in a function call that did not match the expected schema and causing evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_21", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (updateUserProfile) but omitted required fields (UserLanguage, UserTimeZone, UserBirthday) in the parameters, failing to include all necessary user profile information as expected."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"OrderStatus\" to \"Pending\" instead of updating it to \"Out for Delivery,\" failing to provide the actual order status as requested in the user query. This mismatch caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_preference_26", "analysis": "The agent included multiple dietary preferences (\"Gluten-Free, Shellfish-Free\") in the function call, while only \"Gluten-Free\" was expected, leading to a mismatch with the evaluator's criteria for the correct \"updateMenuItem\" call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected arguments and a failure to execute the function as specified by the tool's requirements."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent provided an incorrect newPassword value (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of the expected \"Jessie90#\"), which caused its function call to not match the expected call, leading to the failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in its processPayment function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function signature and preventing the call from being recognized as valid."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Indian\" instead of the correct restaurant name \"Indian restaurant\" for the RestaurantName parameter in the addMenuItem function, resulting in no match to the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function (processPayment) with appropriate parameters, but the \"OrderName\" value used \"Dinner Order\" instead of the expected lowercase \"dinner order,\" causing the function call not to match the expected answer exactly."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly populated the \"UserDietaryPreference\" field instead of leaving it null as expected, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent called processPayment with \"OrderName\" as \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the correct value \"sushi order,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to reject the function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly filled the UserDietaryPreferences field with [\"Gluten-Free\"], which wasn't specified by the user, instead of the expected [\"None\"]. This mismatch caused the function call arguments to not match the evaluator's expectations."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the restaurant name \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" and set \"UserDietaryPreference\" to \"Vegan\" rather than the user's dietary style (\"Spicy\"), resulting in no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required Amount parameter in the processRefund function call and used the incorrect UserRefundPreference (\"Original Method\" instead of the expected \"Store Credit\"), resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_46", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly passed \"Nut-Free\" as the UserDietaryPreference instead of \"Low Sodium\", failing to align with the dietary requirement specified in both the new item's name and the user's likely intent."}

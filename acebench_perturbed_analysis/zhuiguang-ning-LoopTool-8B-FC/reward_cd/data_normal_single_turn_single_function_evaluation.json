{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"eclipseType\": \"total\" parameter in its function call, resulting in an incomplete query that does not specify the user's explicit interest in only total solar eclipses."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly identified the relationships of the beneficiaries as \"Grandson\" and \"Daughter\" instead of both being \"grandchild,\" misassigning \"sister\" as the deceased's daughter rather than as the user's sibling, resulting in a mismatch with expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent formatted the time_frame arguments with full ISO timestamps instead of the expected \"YYYY-MM-DD\" date strings, causing the evaluator to reject the function call despite the correct tool and parameters otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct sourceId (\"1\") for the data source in the function call, instead passing \"API\", which does not match the required format for the techHistoryAnalyzer_generateReport function parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent output a function call with a timeRange \"end\" value including a time component (\"2024-02-15T23:59:59Z\") instead of matching the expected value (\"2024-02-15T00:00:00\") and used a Z-suffixed timestamp, causing a mismatch with the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The model formatted the function call arguments using \"campaignDetails\" and \"targeting\" as top-level keys, but the expected format used \"parameters\" as the top-level key containing these fields. This schema mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent's function call matches the expected parameters, but it used a tool name (hearing_aid_connectivity_check) that was available in the tools list. However, there may be a strict evaluator issue with case sensitivity or another output format, possibly due to the agent failing to follow the required output schema for function calls."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The model omitted the required \"verificationTime\": \"immediate\" parameter in its AccountManager_verifyDocument function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected schema and failure to match the test case."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"classificationPeriod\" parameter in its function call and slightly altered the feature description (\"distinctive long beak\" vs. \"long beak\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call and parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"historical\": false parameter in the traffic_data object and used an imprecise location (\"123 Market St\" instead of \"123 Market St, San Francisco\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent correctly selected the intended function and parameters, but its output format did not match the benchmark’s required function call schema, leading to parsing failure despite otherwise correct intent and information."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent only created a single digital display instead of two as requested, and the content included \"our\" instead of matching the expected \"latest product video\". This mismatch caused the function call not to match the required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra preferences (\"Drawing\", \"Music\") not mentioned in the user's request, instead of limiting the childProfile's preferences to only \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as specified. This mismatch prevented correct function call matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_53", "analysis": "The agent's tool call formatted the JSON payload incorrectly by placing creditHistoryProviders and analysisPeriod inside userData, rather than as top-level parameters. This led to a malformed request that could not be parsed by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call arguments; it used \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" in the ingredients array, resulting in a mismatch with the benchmark's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_58", "analysis": "The agent included \"Wednesday\" in the schedule_availability weekdays, despite the user explicitly stating they are unavailable on Wednesdays. This mismatch caused the function call arguments to not match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary \"readingLevel\" parameter in the function call arguments, causing a schema mismatch and resulting in no valid match for the expected function call. Only the specified parameters should have been used."}

{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent used floating point numbers (0.0, 5.0) for the costAdjustment values in the function call instead of integers (0, 5) as required by the expected parameters, causing a mismatch and test failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent's function call used floating-point values (1000.0, 2000.0) for the budget instead of integers (1000, 2000), causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent used a \"Z\" suffix for the time fields in the \"timeWindow\" parameter, indicating UTC time format, which caused a mismatch with the expected time format lacking the \"Z\" and required minutes set to \":00\". This led to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used \"Great Wall Beijing Segment\" as the siteId instead of the correct \"Great Wall Beijing\", resulting in a parameter mismatch and causing the function call not to match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON for the function call by omitting the final closing brace and bracket, resulting in a parsing error and preventing the function from being invoked as intended."}

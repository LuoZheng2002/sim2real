{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"time_range\" values to the \"time_restrictions\" for each weekday instead of just specifying the days, resulting in arguments that do not match the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the function call arguments by omitting the expected \"monumentDetails\" wrapper and used sample IDs (\"A\" and \"B\") instead of the correct identifiers (\"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\") as specified in the input."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field inside the \"privacy\" object in its function call arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function parameters for ConferenceSessionManager_createSession."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly structured the \"contentData\" parameter as a list of articles instead of the required object with \"articles\" and \"userPreferences\" keys, resulting in a non-matching function call despite using the correct tool and updated preferences."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON was incomplete—it lacked a closing brace at the end, resulting in malformed JSON that could not be parsed by the evaluator. This indicates a failure to fully generate or output a valid, syntactically correct JSON object."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contained malformed JSON—specifically, an extra closing bracket—causing a parsing failure. This was a formatting error, not a reasoning or selection mistake. The correct action was attempted but not properly serialized."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent added an unnecessary period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and leading to the evaluator not recognizing the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_32", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly placed the \"themes\" list inside the \"movieDetails\" argument instead of at the top level per the expected function signature, resulting in a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a function call that did not match the required parameters and failed evaluation. It should have included \"settings\": {} for strict output adherence."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent produced invalid JSON by omitting closing braces in its tool calls, and it also misrepresented the \"penalty\" as 0.1 instead of 10. This caused parsing errors and incorrect application of cancellation policies."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only made one function call for direct employment, omitting the required separate call for indirect employment. It failed to address both direct and indirect employment impacts as explicitly requested by the question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent included an unnecessary and empty \"winePreferences\" field in the function arguments, so its calls did not match the exact input schema expected by the evaluator, resulting in no valid function calls being recognized despite correct intent."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent output malformed JSON due to an extraneous closing quote after the responseTeams array, breaking the JSON structure and preventing tool invocation. This indicates a failure in reliable JSON serialization for function calling."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported \"analysis_depth\" parameter to the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature. This prevented proper matching despite otherwise correct arguments."}

{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The model's function call arguments did not exactly match the expected canonical symptom phrasing (\"excessive crying\" vs. \"crying a lot\", \"constant crying\" vs. \"crying a lot\"), causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as correct; it failed due to non-standardized symptom wording."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent failed to provide argument values closely matching the expected contents (e.g., detailed competitor analysis, customer demographics, and appropriately mapped evaluation criteria), resulting in parameter mismatches that prevented recognition of the function call by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"conflict over AI control\" instead of the expected \"AI control\" as the conflict_element parameter, resulting in argument mismatch and causing the function call to not match evaluator expectations."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly rescheduled all previous tasks along with the new one instead of only scheduling the newly requested \"Prepare Presentation\" task. It also preserved the \"Urgent\" priority instead of mapping it to \"High\" as expected."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly chose finance_advisor_b instead of finance_advisor_a, despite both being available. The task specifically expected a call to finance_advisor_a, but the agent failed to select the designated tool, leading to a mismatch with expected output."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"body_type\" to \"medium build\" instead of the expected standardized value \"medium,\" causing a schema mismatch with the expected function parameters and resulting in no matching function call being recognized."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent selected the wrong function (health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a), omitted the required \"age\" parameter, and failed to match the specified tool and parameters indicated in the system's previous function call pattern."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent used a relevant tool and correct function name but failed to provide the full, detailed problem description as required, omitting context about previous troubleshooting steps and the need for diverse insights, leading to a parameter mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent called analyze_social_data_a instead of the correct analyze_social_data_b as required, and it also formatted preprocess_rules incorrectly as an object rather than as a list. Most crucially, it ignored the need to switch to the correct function."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used the relation label \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" in the function call arguments, leading to a mismatch between actual and expected function input and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent's function call argument values did not exactly match the expected format—specifically, \"age_group\" used \"25 to 35\" instead of \"25-35\", and \"current_brand_status\" was more verbose than the expected \"not well-known,\" causing a strict matching failure."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The agent used the correct function name and parameters, but output formatting did not match the expected benchmark schema, likely due to improper capitalization of the \"title\" value or a mismatch in expected response format, causing a function call match failure."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the user's last name (\"Smith\") in the function call, providing only the first name, which resulted in an incomplete parameter set and a mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included unsupported parameters (\"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\") in the function call to SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery, which do not match the expected function signature, leading to a mismatch and failure to execute the correct API call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent included an unsupported \"printTime\" parameter in the function call, which caused a mismatch with the expected schema and prevented a recognized match, even though all necessary settings were otherwise correctly specified."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"schedule\" parameter (time and frequency) in its function call, thus not setting up the tests to run daily at 6:00 AM as requested in the original question."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent used the correct tool and parameters, but failed to match the expected function call output due to a mismatch in the capitalization of the \"genre\" parameter (\"pop\" instead of \"Pop\"). This prevented exact matching during evaluation."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent included an extra unsupported \"features\" field (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\") in the simulation_parameters, resulting in a function call signature that did not match any available tool, causing the function call to be rejected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_34", "analysis": "The agent outputted ISO 8601 timestamps with a 'Z' suffix for the yoga session timing, while the expected format was without 'Z'. This mismatch caused the evaluator not to recognize the function call as matching, despite correct parameter values otherwise."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values for both locations, provided an invalid year format (\"100-08-01\" instead of \"0100-08-01\"), and failed to match the exact expected function call parameters, leading to a mismatch."}

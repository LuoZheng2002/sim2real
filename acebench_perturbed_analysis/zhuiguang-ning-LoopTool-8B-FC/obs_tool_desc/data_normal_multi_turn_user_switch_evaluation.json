{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_10_0", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary \"details\" parameters (\"theme\" and \"features\") to the function call, deviating from the expected argument schema, which caused a mismatch and failure to match the function signature required by the evaluator."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_9_1", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the required \"applicationPeriod\" parameter (\"Immediate\") in its arguments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_27_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"marketSegment\": \"smartphones\" parameter in the CompetitivePricingAnalyzer_analyzePricing function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the failure."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_11_1", "analysis": "The agent used the incorrect value \"Louvre\" instead of \"LouvreMuseum\" for the museumId parameter, and it incorrectly populated the mustSeeExhibits list, which should have been left empty according to instructions."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_20_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra fields (\"translationFeatures\") to the function call parameters that were not part of the defined API schema, resulting in a schema mismatch and failure to make a valid function call."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_29_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter \"analysisDepth\" to the CustomerDataManager_queryCustomerSegments function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to not recognize the function call as valid."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_32_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"timeOfDay\" parameter in the TravelImageOptimizer_optimizeBatch function call, producing an incomplete request that did not match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_33_1", "analysis": "The root cause is incorrect capitalization in the \"details\" value (\"valuation summary for properties involved\" instead of \"Valuation summary for properties involved\"), leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters and evaluator rejection."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_44_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"group_size\" parameter in the function call, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to reject the call as valid."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_41_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an additional argument, \"influence\": [\"opera\", \"symphony\"], which is not specified or accepted by the function schema, resulting in a non-matching function call despite the correct core parameters."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_46_0", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included specific cities within the \"locations\" parameter instead of only specifying the countries (\"Germany\" and \"France\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call structure that requires only top-level country fields."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_35_0", "analysis": "The agent output the function call in a nonstandard XML-like <tool_call> wrapper instead of pure JSON, causing a parsing failure. The problem is a formatting error, not an issue with the call structure or content itself."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_switch_45_1", "analysis": "The agent included four weeks in the training_schedule parameter, whereas the expected function call only required three weeks. This mismatch in the number of weeks caused the output to not match the expected function call."}

{"id": "normal_preference_4", "analysis": "The agent output \"Sports\" for UserPreferredCategories instead of the required \"Sports Goods,\" resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unrequired parameter (\"previousPurchaseCategories\") and altered the password (\"Jessie90#new\" instead of \"Jessie90#\"), resulting in no exact match for the expected function call. It failed to strictly use the given and expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_8", "analysis": "The agent failed due to a minor mismatch in the 'UserHomeLocation' value—using \"Town near Austin, TX\" instead of the required \"a town near Austin, TX\"—leading to the function call not matching the expected parameters exactly."}
{"id": "normal_preference_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set UserPreferredCategories to \"Books\" instead of \"Wellness\" as expected, indicating a failure to accurately infer or recall the user's relevant product category preferences for the yoga mat purchase."}
{"id": "normal_preference_15", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the correct UserMemberStatus value (\"Bronze\") and instead used \"Standard\", ignoring the user's membership status benefits referenced in the prompt. This led to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_16", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the UserSpendingLimit to 100 instead of the correct value of 350, failing to use or retrieve the user's usual spending limit, even though all other parameters were correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_17", "analysis": "The agent abbreviated \"San Diego, California\" to \"San Diego, CA\" in the UserHomeLocation parameter, failing to preserve the expected full location format required by the function call, which led to a parameter mismatch and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_preference_18", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"UserMemberStatus\" parameter in the calculateShippingCost function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and thus failing to compute shipping cost correctly for the user's status."}
{"id": "normal_preference_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly sent an order update with the status \"Pending\" instead of the correct status \"Out for Delivery,\" failing to provide the expected progress update on the user's current order as specified."}
{"id": "normal_preference_29", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature and causing the evaluator to report no matching function call found."}
{"id": "normal_preference_30", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly modified the password by appending \"new\" to it, resulting in \"Jessie90#new\" instead of retaining the original \"Jessie90#\". This alteration led to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_31", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"HomeLocation\" parameter in the processPayment function call, making its arguments incomplete and thus not matching the expected function signature. This resulted in the evaluator not recognizing the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_34", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Indian\" instead of \"Indian restaurant\") and improperly formatted the dietary preference as \"Vegetarian, Gluten-Free\" rather than just \"Gluten-Free,\" leading to a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_35", "analysis": "The model incorrectly capitalized the \"OrderName\" value (\"Dinner Order\" instead of \"dinner order\"), causing its function call not to match the expected parameters exactly, despite all key fields being otherwise correct."}
{"id": "normal_preference_38", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect restaurant name (\"Japanese restaurant\" instead of \"Favorite Japanese Restaurant\") and incorrectly included the user's dietary preference as a parameter, which the function signature does not require. This caused the function call to not match the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_preference_39", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Sushi Platter\" instead of the expected \"sushi order\" for the OrderName parameter in the processPayment function call, leading to a mismatch and failure to recognize the intended function call."}
{"id": "normal_preference_40", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly inferred the user's dietary preferences as \"Gluten-Free\" instead of using the actual value \"None,\" leading to a mismatch in the function call parameters required for submitReview."}
{"id": "normal_preference_43", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"Kimchi Palace\" instead of \"My favorite Korean joint\" for the restaurant name and set the dietary preference as \"Vegan\" rather than \"Spicy\", disregarding the user's specified context and preferences."}
{"id": "normal_preference_44", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"Amount\" parameter and incorrectly set \"UserRefundPreference\" to \"Original Method\" instead of the user's actual preference (\"Store Credit\"), resulting in a function call that doesn't match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_preference_48", "analysis": "The agent used a generic placeholder (\"New Home Location\") instead of the correct value (\"San Diego, CA\") for the homeLocation parameter, failing to update the user profile with the requested specific information."}

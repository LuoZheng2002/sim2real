{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly listed the beneficiaries' relationships as \"Grandson\" and \"Daughter\" instead of the expected \"grandchild\" for both, and also used their names (\"User\" and \"Sister\") instead of their designated roles, leading to a parameter mismatch with the expected function call schema."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_7", "analysis": "The agent included unnecessary time components (\"T00:00:00Z\", \"T23:59:59Z\") in the \"start\" and \"end\" date fields instead of providing dates in the required \"YYYY-MM-DD\" format, causing a mismatch with the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_9", "analysis": "The agent failed to use the required \"sourceId\" value of \"1\" for the data source, instead inventing \"techdataapi\" as the sourceId. This caused a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_18", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the datetime parameters by including a 'Z' to indicate UTC (e.g., \"2023-05-28T12:00:00Z\"), while the expected format omitted the 'Z' (e.g., \"2023-05-28T12:00:00\"), leading to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_20", "analysis": "The agent included extra parameters (\"includeHistoricalData\") and formatted the time values with a 'Z' suffix and end time as \"2024-02-15T23:59:59Z\" instead of matching the expected format, causing an exact function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_26", "analysis": "The agent generated a correct function call but used an incorrect campaign title (\"Hawaii Adventure Campaign\" instead of \"Adventure and Travel in Hawaii\"), causing the output to not exactly match the expected parameters and leading to evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_27", "analysis": "The agent's function call failed due to a mismatch in the device_name casing; it used \"Smartphone\"/\"Laptop\" instead of the expected lowercase \"smartphone\"/\"laptop\", preventing exact match with the evaluator's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_28", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"verificationTime\" parameter in the function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected tool signature. This omission caused the function call not to match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_31", "analysis": "The agent's function call omitted the \"classificationPeriod\" parameter and did not specify \"blue and white feathers\" as a feature, resulting in incomplete and imprecise input for the classification tool."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_37", "analysis": "The model omitted the \"historical\": false parameter in the traffic_data, and the store location lacked the city (\"San Francisco\"). These missing fields caused its function call not to match the expected schema, leading to failure."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_42", "analysis": "The agent constructed the correct function call and parameters, but the imageData value was a generic placeholder (\"base64 encoded string of the image data\") instead of using the user's provided base64 string, failing to accurately echo the provided input."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_47", "analysis": "The agent's tool call response had malformed JSON due to a missing closing brace, preventing parsing. Additionally, the digital display content did not precisely match the expected phrase (\"our latest product video\" vs. \"latest product video\"). The root cause is improper JSON formatting."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_50", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly expanded the child's preferences to include \"Drawing\" and \"Music\" instead of restricting them to only \"Puzzles\" and \"Reading\" as specified in the user request, resulting in a non-matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_56", "analysis": "The agent used \"pure green tea leaves\" instead of the expected \"green tea leaves\" in the ingredients list for the function call, leading to an argument mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_62", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the \"readingLevel\" field in the function arguments, which was not required or specified in the tool schema, resulting in a parameter mismatch and failed function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_74", "analysis": "The agent output the correct function call, but used floats (0.0, 5.0) for costAdjustment instead of integers (0, 5) as required by the function signature, resulting in a parameter type mismatch and failed matching."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_75", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set \"perennials\" to false in the preferences despite the user expressing they don't mind perennials, which should be interpreted as allowing or preferring them (true). This parameter mismatch caused the function call to not match expectations."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_79", "analysis": "The agent formatted the function call fields as \"min\": 1000.0 and \"max\": 2000.0 (floats) instead of integers (\"min\": 1000, \"max\": 2000). This type mismatch led to the evaluator not matching the function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_81", "analysis": "The agent provided timestamps in the timeWindow with a \"T\" and \"Z\" (ISO 8601 format), while the expected format omitted both (\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and no function call match."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_85", "analysis": "The agent added an extra, unsupported \"time_frame\" parameter in the function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature and resulting in no valid function call being detected."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_91", "analysis": "The agent used an incorrect siteId value (\"GreatWall_Beijing\") instead of the expected string (\"Great Wall Beijing\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_94", "analysis": "The agent failed by producing a malformed JSON object for the tool call due to a missing closing brace, resulting in a parsing error. This indicates a syntax generation issue, not an error in content or function selection."}
{"id": "normal_single_turn_single_function_96", "analysis": "The model included an extra unsupported argument \"includeCulturalInfluences\" in the \"details\" object, which is not expected or accepted by the tool, causing the function call to fail to match the required signature."}

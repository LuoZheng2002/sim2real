{"id": "normal_atom_bool_10", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"work_focus\" parameter in the function call. It failed to explicitly indicate whether the schedule should include work commitments, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_11", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"include_diy_solutions\": true parameter in the function call, failing to request repair suggestions as the user's question explicitly asked for advice on fixing the issue."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_12", "analysis": "The agent called the correct function but omitted required parameters (\"include_attachment\" and \"encryption_level\"), providing only the email address. It failed to specify that the message should include an attachment and use high encryption, as expected."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_25", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required parameter \"include_trending\": true in its function call, failing to specify that trending platforms should be included, which was necessary to match the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported argument (\"include_weekend_rules\": false) to the DailyTrafficRuleNotifier function call instead of only passing the required \"area_code\" parameter as specified by the tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_33", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the analysis flags (include_age_group_analysis, include_location_analysis, include_device_usage) to true instead of false as required by the expected output, resulting in a parameter mismatch and no matching function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_46", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the \"offers_gluten_free\": true parameter in its function call despite the user's explicit requirement for gluten-free options, resulting in an incomplete and incorrect use of the tool."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_48", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"include_indoor_suggestions\" parameter in the WeekendWeatherChecker function call, resulting in a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_bool_49", "analysis": "The agent mistakenly used \"technology startup\" as the industry parameter instead of the required \"technology\" value, leading to a parameter mismatch and failure to match the expected function call signature."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_7", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly specified \"time_range\" for each weekday in \"time_restrictions\", whereas the function expects only the \"day\" field per entry. This mismatch in argument format caused the function call to not match the expected schema."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_8", "analysis": "The agent omitted the \"Sample\" prefix in the sampleID fields (\"A\" and \"B\" instead of \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\"), causing a mismatch with the function's expected parameter format. This led to the function call not being recognized as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_16", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"participantData\": false field in the \"privacy\" object of the sessionDetails argument, resulting in a function call that did not exactly match the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_21", "analysis": "The agent's tool call output contains malformed JSON: it is missing the closing brace at the end, causing a parsing failure. This syntactic error prevented the evaluator from recognizing and processing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_22", "analysis": "The agent failed to standardize the \"culture\" fields, outputting country names (\"Vietnam\", \"UK\", \"Spain\") instead of the expected cultural descriptors (\"Vietnamese\", \"British\", \"Spanish\"), causing a mismatch with the tool's required parameter format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_23", "analysis": "The model incorrectly placed the \"gear\" information outside of \"hikingDetails\" in its function call arguments, rather than nesting it within \"hikingDetails\" as required by the expected schema. This structural error led to a function call mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_27", "analysis": "The agent output malformed JSON for the tool call, failing to close the outer object properly. This syntax error prevented the function call from being executed, despite the parameters otherwise matching the user’s requested changes."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_28", "analysis": "The agent included an extraneous period at the end of the \"location\" value (\"123 Main St.\" instead of \"123 Main St\"), causing the function call parameters not to match exactly with the expected format."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_35", "analysis": "The agent omitted the empty \"settings\" object for the summary widget in the second dashboard, resulting in a schema mismatch with the expected function call and causing the evaluator to report no matching function call found."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_37", "analysis": "The agent placed the \"irrigation\" parameter incorrectly under \"greeningOptions\" instead of nesting it inside \"verticalGardens\", resulting in malformed JSON and causing the function call to fail parsing. Proper JSON structure as per the expected schema was not followed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_38", "analysis": "The agent failed to output valid JSON due to unmatched curly braces, causing a parsing error. Additionally, it used penalty as 0.1 (float) instead of 10 (int or percent), not matching the user's specified penalty, and omitted the penalty field entirely in \"advance\" cancellation policies."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_39", "analysis": "The agent only analyzed direct employment, omitting the required separate function call for indirect employment. The question explicitly requested analysis for both direct and indirect employment impacts, but the agent made a single call instead of two."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_41", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an empty \"winePreferences\" parameter in its function calls, which did not match the expected function call signature that includes only the \"cheese\" parameter. This parameter mismatch caused the evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_45", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON in the tool call by omitting a closing brace, resulting in an unparsable request. This syntax error prevented successful invocation of the traffic_update_notifier function."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_46", "analysis": "The agent produced malformed JSON due to an extra closing quotation mark after the final curly brace in the \"responseTeams\" array, causing a syntax error and preventing the function call from being parsed."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_deep_48", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported parameter \"analysis_depth\" in its function call to content_moderation_analysis, resulting in a mismatch with the expected tool signature and failure to call the function as specified."}

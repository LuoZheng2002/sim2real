{"id": "normal_similar_api_3", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly selected baby_health_check_A instead of the required baby_health_check_B, failing to use the tool that specifically addresses visible veins and emphasizes related symptoms as described in the input and tool descriptions."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_4", "analysis": "The agent outputted the temperature range as a descriptive string (\"18 to 25 degrees Celsius\") instead of using the required numerical range format (\"18 to 25\"), resulting in a mismatch with the expected parameters for the function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_9", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly invoked phrase_interpret_b instead of the required phrase_interpret_a, failing to maintain consistency in tool selection as instructed by the system's previous use of phrase_interpret_a for a similar interpretation task."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_12", "analysis": "The agent's function call included incorrect and overly generic values for competitor analysis, customer demographics, and evaluation criteria, failing to synthesize or normalize details from the conversation as expected in the parameter structure, leading to a mismatch with the required function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used \"conflict over AI control\" as the conflict_element value instead of the required \"AI control,\" failing to match the exact parameter expected by the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_18", "analysis": "The agent rescheduled all tasks, including those already scheduled, instead of only adding the new \"Prepare Presentation\" task. Additionally, it failed to map \"Urgent\" to \"High\" priority as expected, resulting in an incorrect function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_21", "analysis": "The agent's function call contained minor deviations in parameter wording (e.g., \"technology and renewable energy sectors\" instead of \"technology and renewable energy\"; goal phrasing differences), causing a mismatch with the strict expected parameters and the evaluator to not recognize a match."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_23", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called syntax_parsing_b instead of syntax_parsing_a, failing to match the tool use pattern expected from the previous English example. This shows it did not maintain tool consistency when switching to a similar task in another language."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_25", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly used the \"20-25\" age range instead of the correct \"25-30\" age range based on the user's stated age (26), resulting in a mismatch with the expected function call parameters."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_29", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called health_tips_b instead of health_tips_a, and also omitted the required \"age\" parameter, failing to match the tool and parameters specified in the ground truth for dietary advice."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_30", "analysis": "The agent provided only a generic problem description to the clarity_guide_b tool instead of supplying the more detailed context that included attempted troubleshooting steps and a specific request for diverse perspectives, resulting in an incomplete function call."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_31", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly provided the targets as a separate array instead of integrating each target value into its corresponding data entry's structure, resulting in a function call format mismatch with the expected input for model_optimizer_y."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_36", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly called analyze_social_data_a instead of analyze_social_data_b, which was the required function. Additionally, it used the wrong function signature for preprocess_rules (should be a list, not a dictionary) and included extra evaluation metrics beyond just F1 score."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_41", "analysis": "The agent used \"coworker\" instead of the expected \"co-worker\" in the relation field value, resulting in a function call argument mismatch and failure to meet the evaluator's strict string matching requirements."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_43", "analysis": "The agent used parameter values (\"age_group\": \"25 to 35\", \"current_brand_status\": \"fairly new and currently not well-known in the general market\") that did not match the expected formats (\"age_group\": \"25-35\", \"current_brand_status\": \"not well-known\"), causing evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_similar_api_48", "analysis": "The model's function call argument \"title\" used different capitalization (\"AI Applications in Oncology\") than the expected (\"AI applications in oncology\"), causing an exact match failure. The agent did not preserve exact title text as required by the function schema."}

{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_6_0", "analysis": "The agent failed to convert the provided date range (\"March 8\" to \"March 22\") into the required ISO format (\"2024-03-08\" to \"2024-03-22\") as expected by the tool, instead passing informal date strings."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_10_0", "analysis": "The agent's tool call JSON is incomplete due to a missing closing brace, resulting in an invalid JSON object. This syntax error prevented the tool call from being parsed or executed as intended."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_30_1", "analysis": "The agent used \"most recent\" instead of the required \"most-recent\" format for the feedbackId parameter, causing a mismatch and failure to invoke the function with the correct argument."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_1", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"User\" role in the securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles call, omitting a role that was previously specified and configured. This led to an incomplete role setup compared to the expected parameters."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_32_0", "analysis": "The agent called securityManagementAPI_setupUserRoles instead of the required securityManagementAPI_configureAccessControl function, thus failing to assign specific permissions or enable auditing as requested in the task."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_16_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"notifications\" parameter when calling the festival_art_schedule_creator function, failing to include notification settings as specified by the function's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_26_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly altered the reviewReason from \"to ensure compliance\" (as provided by the user) to \"ensure compliance\" (omitting \"to\"), resulting in a parameter mismatch that caused the function call to not match the expected output."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_47_1", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"frequency\": \"Weekly\" in the updatedToolSettings when only \"method\": \"Email\" should have been changed; the frequency should have been omitted, matching only the explicitly requested modification."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_1", "analysis": "The agent generated identical innovation rates (65) for both teams in the report, instead of using the correct individual rates (70 for Team Alpha, 60 for Team Beta), indicating it failed to preserve or use the distinct per-team innovation rates provided earlier."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_35_2", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly treated \"near the Colosseum\" as the restaurant's location and as a special request, rather than specifying it in the location field. The \"restaurant_name\" field was filled with a generic descriptor instead of an actual restaurant name."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_44_2", "analysis": "The model failed to match the expected function call due to a capitalization mismatch in the \"agenda\" parameter (\"finalize and sign the contract\" vs. \"Finalize and sign the contract\"), causing the evaluator to not recognize the otherwise correct function invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_1", "analysis": "The agent omitted the insurance cost parameter ($120.5) in the travel budget calculation, despite having that information from prior insurance options provided, resulting in an incomplete function call to travel_budget_manager_calculate_travel_budget."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"pricingOptions\" parameter in its function call, which specifies the use of demand-driven pricing and forecasting, resulting in a function call that did not fully meet the tool's expected input schema."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_49_2", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"returnDate\" in the travelDates parameter of the travelDealsAggregator_getFlightDeals function call, failing to use the full round-trip date range the user specified (December 30th departure, January 3rd return)."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_39_1", "analysis": "The model's \"preferences\" field included \"breakfast included\" instead of the expected \"breakfast,\" causing a mismatch with the benchmark's strict parameter expectation and resulting in no matching function call. The agent failed to normalize the preference wording as required."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_21_0", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter (\"feedback_type\": \"overall_experience\") to the manage_feedback_collection function call, causing the function signature to not match and resulting in evaluation failure. Only the specified parameters should have been included."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_36_0", "analysis": "The agent included transactional leader team data in the function call, despite the tool being intended only for transformational leaders. It failed to filter out teams not matching the required “transformational” leader type prior to invocation."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_24_0", "analysis": "The agent used \"monthly installments\" as the optionType instead of the expected \"installments,\" causing a mismatch in function call parameters. This discrepancy prevented the output from matching the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_46_0", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"duration\" field in the \"coverage_options\" parameter when calling travel_budget_manager_get_insurance_options, resulting in a parameter mismatch with the expected function call signature."}
{"id": "normal_multi_turn_user_adjust_43_0", "analysis": "The agent slightly altered the string for \"desired_qualities\" by adding \"at least\" to the experience requirement, which caused the function call arguments not to match exactly with the expected parameters, resulting in a mismatch error."}

{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_10", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included \"resolution\" and \"cloudCoverage\" parameters in the function call, which are not part of the expected schema for SatelliteArchive_getHistoricalImagery, leading to a mismatch and failure to match the function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_12", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included the extra parameter \"printTime\": \"medium\" in the function call, which is not part of the expected or defined parameters for artistic_3dPrecisionEnhancer, leading to a mismatch with the available tool signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_13", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included extra protocol details (\"details\" field with pairing steps and benefits) in the function call arguments, which do not match the expected function signature, leading to a failure in recognizing the intended DeviceConnection_authenticateBluetooth call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_15", "analysis": "The agent omitted the required \"schedule\" parameter (time and frequency) when configuring the test management tool, thus failing to fulfill the scheduling aspect of the user's request for daily 6:00 AM test runs."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_17", "analysis": "The agent specified the genre parameter as \"pop\" (lowercase) instead of \"Pop\" (capitalized) as expected, resulting in a function call mismatch due to case sensitivity in parameter values."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_20", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"dataSources\" argument in the function call; only \"region\" and \"timeRange\" parameters are valid, leading to a mismatch with the expected function signature."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_24", "analysis": "The agent added an extra \"eventTypes\" parameter not required by the function signature, causing its function call to not match the expected schema and resulting in evaluator rejection. The function should have included only \"caseId\" and \"timeRange\"."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_32", "analysis": "The agent added unnecessary features (\"gravity simulation\", \"density mapping\", \"fragmentation algorithms\", \"3D visualization\") to the simulation_parameters, resulting in a function call signature that did not match the expected format and caused the evaluator to reject the call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_35", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added extra parameters (\"sources\", \"keywords\", \"include_multimedia\") not present in the function's expected signature, resulting in function calls that did not match the allowed interface and causing evaluator mismatch."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_37", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly added an unsupported \"feedbackMode\": \"textual\" field in the correctionPreferences for each function call, deviating from the expected parameter schema and causing a mismatch with the available tool's required parameters."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_38", "analysis": "The agent used slightly incorrect longitude values (last decimal digit differs) and provided the year for the Colosseum query as \"100-08-01\" instead of the required \"0100-08-01\", leading to function call mismatches and evaluation failure."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_45", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly formatted the \"time\" parameter using ISO 8601 timestamps with 'Z' (UTC marker), while the expected format omits the seconds and the 'Z' suffix. This mismatch caused the evaluator to not recognize the function call as correct."}
{"id": "normal_atom_object_short_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly made two separate function calls for SSL/TLS renewal and data encryption instead of combining both operations into a single call to the WebSecurity_EncryptionManager with both parameter sets, as required by the tool's expected input."}

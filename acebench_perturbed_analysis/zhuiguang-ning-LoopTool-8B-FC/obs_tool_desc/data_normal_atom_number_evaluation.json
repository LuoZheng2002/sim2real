{"id": "normal_atom_number_7", "analysis": "The agent added an unsupported parameter, \"analysisDepth\", to the ShootingTechniqueEvaluator function call. The available tool only accepts \"videoPath\" and \"feedbackType\", causing a mismatch with the expected parameters and resulting in the evaluator not recognizing the function call."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_32", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the correct service sector growth (5.6) and foreign investment (900) values as required; instead, it defaulted to 0 for both, disregarding the user’s explicit focus and the likely relevant data needed for the comparison."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_33", "analysis": "The agent failed to include the required \"characterName\" parameter (\"Itachi Uchiha\") in its GetCharacterBackground function call, resulting in a parameter mismatch and preventing successful retrieval of the character's background."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_44", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly set the \"receptionDelay\" parameter to 5 instead of the required value of 1200, failing to match the expected function call for diagnosing message delay issues. This indicates a misunderstanding or extraction error regarding the user's reported delay duration."}
{"id": "normal_atom_number_47", "analysis": "The agent incorrectly included an unsupported \"currency\" parameter in the StockTrendEvaluator function call, causing a mismatch with the expected function signature that only accepts \"companySymbol\" and \"analysisPeriod.\""}

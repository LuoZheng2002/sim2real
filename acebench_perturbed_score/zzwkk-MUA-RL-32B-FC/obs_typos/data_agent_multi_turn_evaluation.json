Checking for flights on nearby dates (July 14th or 16th)\n2. Being open to different cabin classes\n3. Considering alternative airports if applicable\n\nWould you like me to search for flights on a different date, or would you prefer to be transferred to a human agent who might have access to additional booking options?\nuser: No, please keep searching for July 15th.

Check for flights on different dates outside of July 14-16\n2. Consider alternative airports near Beijing or Shanghai\n3. Explore different cabin classes (including business class)\n4. Check for international flights that might connect between Beijing and Shanghai with stops in other countries\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

Could you please confirm exactly what error message you're receiving from the system?\nagent: I apologize for the confusion, but I need to clarify something important. The system has returned the same error message twice: \"Incorrect username or password.\" This means that the credentials you're providing (user ID: Fnark, password: 'password456') are not being accepted by the system.\n\nThis could be due to several reasons:\n1. The credentials might be correct for a different system or airline\n2. There might be a case sensitivity issue (though I've tried with the exact case you provided)\n3. The account might need to be activated or might have some restrictions\n\nAt this point, I would recommend:\n1.

Is there a way you can attempt retrieving user information with just my user ID, without the password, to see if the account exists?\nagent: I apologize, but I don't have a function that allows me to look up user information with just the user ID without authentication. The available tools require both user ID and password for authentication purposes.\n\nThe only function that deals with user information is get_user_details, which requires both user_id and password parameters. This is likely a security measure to protect user accounts and personal information.\n\nIf you're concerned about account existence or status, the best options would be:\n1.
